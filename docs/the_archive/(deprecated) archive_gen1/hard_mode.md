# Hard Mode: Package it yourself

1.  Create a folder with the name of the book, story, or the complete title of the card (for official cards).
	1.  The Very Hungry Caterpillar’s First Seasons
2.  Place all files into that folder. Follow the specified naming conventions
    -  Album cover -> Cover Art.jpg
    -  Card cover -> Card Art.jpg
    -  Chapter icons -> 01 Chapter Name in Camel Case.jpg
		-  Only one icon should exist for each chapter
		-  Include icons for ALL chapters
		-  Filename should match the chapter name but use a different file extension
    -  Chapters -> 01 Filename in Camel Case.mp3
	    -  For cards with 99 or less chapters, use a single 0 for chapters 1 through 9 (01, 02…09)
	    -  For cards with 100 to 999 chapters, use two 0s for chapters 1 through 9 (001, 002…009) and a single 0 for chapters 10 through 99 (010, 011…099)
3. Create a text file with the cataloging details as follows:
	-  Title -
	- Author -
    - Read By -
    - Duration -
    - Language -
    - Age Rating -
    - Category
    - Store Page
    - Accent
    - These details will be posted into the spreadsheet and the text file will be removed from the zip file.
11.  Any other files can be named reasonably and included in the folder. 
12.  Upload the whole folder into the [Inbox](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sJ0UojaPeGd3g2dvsch_0TqejBvX6MuS) so it can be cataloged for sorting.
