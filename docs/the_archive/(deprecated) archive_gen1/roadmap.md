#Tooling Roadmap

Submission Portal is some kind of front end where people can send in their content. Perhaps we limit it to only yoto URL submissions, that will force people to create a card/MYO before submitting it.

`Archiver` gets to its perfectly stable state where we can throw a URL at it, and the content gets pulled down, packaged and sent off to a Library.
- Archiver could be the "official" tool for the community, but it also works as a self-hosted backup tool
- You've also got a few "online archiver" variants as well.
- that chrome extension, me and a few others have versions of the JS script. I made mine into a tampermonkey script too.

`Library` collects and showcases links to available packages, shows the contents of the package (quality of the contents, not the actual contents), and helps people filter and sort through things to find what they want.

`Tools` is able to take an archive from Archiver and plug it into a brand new, private, MYO playlist for someone.

`Guides` is some sort of tips and guides repository where things like the
- "how do you swap the SD card on a Mini" or
- "Buying a yoto for your kid for Christmas/birthday? do this first!" or
- "Free tools to make your MYO cards 10x better" or
- "3dprint-ables for your yoto" or
- "how to submit content to the Library
