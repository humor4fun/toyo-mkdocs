## Using your Yoto Player

1.  Can you set a sleep timer on Yoto Players?
	- Kind of, sort of. Yoto has the ability to set a “night time” mode, which has the ability to limit the volume to 0, which effectively makes it mute. However, there is only a single schedule for night time mode, so you would not be able to set a separate volume limit prior to “night time.” An alternative would be to make use of Home Assistant to schedule the volume limitations to change at different times. Tutorials for integrating Home Assistant and Scheduling Tasks are coming soon.
2.  Can you set a wake up alarm on Yoto Players?
3.  Why won’t my Yoto connect to my hotspot?
	- Your hotspot may be set to 5gHz and I believe the Yoto player can only connect to 2.5gHz. You should be able to go into your device’s hotspot settings and see what gHz it is putting out.
	- Additionally, Yoto Players can only connect to WiFi connections that have required passwords, so ensure that that option is enabled on your hotspot.
4.  Why won’t my podcasts play?
	- If you know that the RSS feed and card are working correctly, the most common reason is that the player does not have access to the internet. Unlike normal playlists and books, podcasts are not downloaded to the Yoto Player itself, and require near constant internet access to work.

## Hardware

1.  Can I purchase NFC cards from sources other than Yoto?
	- Yes! See our tutorials on how to [source these cards](guides/choosing_a_3rd_party_nfc_card.md), as well as [using them](guides/using_3rd_party_nfc_cards.md).
2.  Are Yoto Players smart home compatible?
	- Yes! There is a Yoto Player integration available for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). Tutorials on adding your Yoto Players are coming soon!

## Content

1.  The content I want is not available in the Archive. What are my options?
2.  How can I put Podcasts on a Yoto Card?
	- This can be done on the [“My Playlists” page](https://my.yotoplay.com/my-cards). Further tutorials on using podcasts are coming soon.
3.  Can I sell or trade cards here?
	- No. There are other fora on the internet for Buying/Selling/Trading Yoto cards, but those activities are not allowed in the Discord server. Attempting to do so may result in administrative actions.
