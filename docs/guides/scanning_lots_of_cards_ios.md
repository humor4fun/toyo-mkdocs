# Scanning Lots of Cards (iOS)

Do you have a lot of cards you want to scan? These instructions will help you set up a Shortcut using a premium app ($5.99 USD). Think of it like buying one more card to ensure you can safely backup all your cards, not to mention the app purchase also lets you get all kinds of other Shortcut tools that you can use for anything else your heart desires.

## How it Works

1. The shortcut pops a window asking you to scan a card
2. It will copy the link off the card to the clipboard then paste it into the Note that you selected; text is always appended to the end of the note
3. When complete, it will open the Yoto app again so you can move to the next card quickly


## Setup
1. Download an app called [Toolbox Pro for Shortcuts+](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977) (click the link on your phone)
