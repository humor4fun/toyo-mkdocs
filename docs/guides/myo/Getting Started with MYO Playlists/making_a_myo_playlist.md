# Making a MYO Playlist

Author: [u/playchime](https://www.reddit.com/u/playchime)

Yoto makes it very easy to make MYO playlists, and you can make them either in your web browser of choice on your computer or mobile/tablet, or using the app on mobile/tablet. As this whole document covers getting files using a computer, I will cover using a computer first.

*Please note this guide assumes you have already signed up for a Yoto account.*
 
Please also note you do not yet need to own a Yoto device to be able to sign up and make playlists! I totally recommend signing up before purchasing so you can try out making a playlist to see how you feel about the process/using the app/etc. You can also start making them while your Yoto is in transit to you so you have playlists ready to be listened to when it arrives! 

Are you using a [computer](playlist_computer.md) or working on a [phone or tablet](playlist_yoto_app.md)?
