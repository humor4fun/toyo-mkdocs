# Using the Card Collector Tool

## Before You Get Started

-   Do you have the link to the content on the Yoto Store? This is needed to cross check meta data and helps to ensure duplicate backups are not made.
-   If you are submitting for the first time, and wish to gain access to the Archive, please also read [Apply for the Archive](applying_to_the_archive.md) for special requirements on becoming verified.

`Official Cards` are physical cards that were purchased from Yoto. These most often have a yellow back. Only these cards count towards the submission requirements during the application process.

`MYO Card` also includes any MYO card that was loaded with Official Yoto content. These cards do not currently count towards the submission requirements during the application process.

## What happens to my card URLs after I submit them?

Once submitted, card URLs are scanned for authenticity to ensure the content will be in the appropriate format. Then, the content is linked with its store URL where additional meta data can be fetched. Once this is complete, the all of the data - audio files, artwork, meta data, etc - is backed up in the Archive so that a user who have purchased that content may retrieve it.

## üí°Tips & Tricksüí°

-   Any card type can be used - Official Content Card Purchased from Yoto; a Yoto MYO Card; or a third party NFC card. The important thing is the content itself is from the Official Yoto Store.
-   If the content is no longer available on the Yoto Store, please leave a note in the Store URL field for the TOYO Administrators.
-   Your previous scans can be found in the ‚ÄúMy datasets‚Äù section of the NXP TagWriter app.  This information can be useful for future reference, or for making copies of your own content onto other cards using the ‚ÄúWrite tags‚Äù function.
