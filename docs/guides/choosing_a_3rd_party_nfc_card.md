# Choosing a 3rd Party NFC Card

Disclaimer: *The TOYO Team highly encourages individuals to purchase Official Yoto MYO cards for use with any MYO Playlist. Purchasing these Official cards helps support Yoto as a company by paying for hosting fees for all MYO Playlist content. Official MYO cards also offer the easiest, most user friendly process to link and use. However, TOYO recognizes that official Yoto MYO cards are often Out of Stock or that previously purchased cards may become lost or damaged. In light of that, we offer this guide on 3rd Party Alternative NFC Cards that can be used within the Yoto ecosystem.*

## Testing & Formatting your Cards

When you receive a new allotment of cards, it is suggested that you test them to ensure they are not formatted to 128b.


1. Using NXP TagWriter, use the `Read` function on your new card(s).
2. Under `Tag Details` the Memory Information should read **48 bytes.**
3. If Memory Information reads as blank, you can format
