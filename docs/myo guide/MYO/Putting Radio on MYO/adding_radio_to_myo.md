# Adding Radio to MYO

**Please note I keep a document with links to radio link databases and selected individual stations [here](yoto_radio_stations.md)**. These *should* all be tested/working, so it’s a good jumping off point!

Using your Yoto player for radio is something I see a lot of people get tripped up over, as it doesn’t work like normal radio, doesn’t use the same stations, and it isn’t easy to parse what kind of stations will be the *right* kind. Even I couldn’t directly explain to you how to tell if a link will work or not–I just do it by trial and error, which is why I made a document with working links haha.

That said, once you do have a working link you’d like to add to your player, adding the station is actually pretty simple!
