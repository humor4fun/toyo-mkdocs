# Using Libby for MYO

The solution is a little clumsy at the moment, and will still require a basic level of comfort with editing audio for longer stories. I’m still testing this out, so I’d welcome any feedback you have!  

Anyway, I’ve only seen people suggest ripping content from Libby by recording it while it plays. There’s nothing specifically wrong with this option–recording through an internal source shouldn’t really create any quality loss to my knowledge–but also man that’s time consuming haha. This method isn’t exactly un-time-consuming, since editing will still be required for longer stories, but it should offer significant improvement. 

You will only be able to do this on a computer, though you should be able to use any mainstream browser of your choice (I use Firefox, and I am on Windows). We will be using [Video Download Helper](https://www.downloadhelper.net/) to acquire the audio (despite the name it works for audio as well). Please read the [Video Download Helper tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tIgOfJIKQv1wiuCZR37_k0wjohjraodcsZrLAhdvqqc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wwc0u0r048q1) also in this document to familiarize yourself with the basics first. I will be assuming you have seen it just to make things a little more concise. This “tutorial” (it’s more just notes at the minute) will specifically be about any quirks that might exist with Libby in particular, and just kind of noting down my experience so far as I play around with it. 

First you will obviously need to have access to an audiobook on Libby. You also need to be logged into Libby on your computer in your web browser, and then open the audiobook and press play. Download Helper should then show an MP3 source that you can download.

Currently I am not sure if it’s Libby or Download Helper resulting in some quirks–the audiobook collection I tested things with downloaded in about one hour and ten minute chunks, give or take. It initially showed only 1 chunk to download, which I did and then listened to the end of it to see what chapter it had ended at. I then navigated to the chapter that would follow that one and pressed play on that one, which generated a new chunk of audio to download starting from that point, which then ended at another chapter, repeat until I finished downloading the whole book. These chunks might be a result of how the book is actually hosted on Libby–it may just be 7 roughly-one-hour chunks on the server side, and therefore other books might be in neat chapters or even the whole story as a single MP3–but I’m not sure yet until I have more data to work with.  

If you’re only downloading short children’s stories I expect it will download the whole story in one go and you will never have to worry about making sure you’re navigating to the right chapters to download the whole thing, or with splitting it up afterwards. If anyone tries it with short stories, please do report your results to me, I’d love to know!

But for those of us stuck with longer MP3s, you’re going to need to manually cut the chapters out. Audacity is good for this, and I’ll add a tutorial about it at some point.
  
I do believe this method could also likely be used to download those pesky Audible books, but I do not subscribe to them so I currently have no way to test this other than by attempting to download some of their samples (which did work, btw!).
