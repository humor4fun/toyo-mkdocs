# Yoto Radio Stations

## Databases
*This is a WIP! I may come back and fill in more stations, but with the databases (linked below) other people have already made, it's not a high priority right now.  I would recommend that you scan the stations yourself as well before adding them to your children’s libraries!*

  

### [Yoto FM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSb2f39I9zuhKfxu5iD1AgIDy5n5B2QpEs1wzcnG-SHZe4rywO_CSkEc0v2vkZlM6IwjgWp0NeCgVL6/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)

A fantastic resource document of Yoto-tested radio links shared with me from another (anonymous) Yoto enthusiast! This is way more thorough than anything I'll end up doing here so I recommend you look here first!

### Yoto Live!

[http://www.yoto.live/index.asp  
](http://www.yoto.live/index.asp)A collection of links to kids music tested for Yoto players! Look here second! Links here will not be mirrored here.

### RadioBrowser

[https://www.radio-browser.info](https://www.radio-browser.info)

A general database of internet radio streaming links. As this is not specifically-curated, links there that I have had an opportunity to skim will be mirrored here, but it’s worth a search if you’re looking for something specific.
  
  

## Children’s Radio

### Fun Kids

Fun Kids Christmas: [https://n36a-eu.rcs.revma.com/s1gvh2z3tm0uv?rj-ttl=5&rj-tok=AAABk1OpUmcA-pR5OwaC1FQ06Q](https://n36a-eu.rcs.revma.com/s1gvh2z3tm0uv?rj-ttl=5&rj-tok=AAABk1OpUmcA-pR5OwaC1FQ06Q)

I assume once we get to January this won’t be Christmas music anymore, but it’s Christmas music right now.

Fun Kids Soundtracks: [https://n39a-eu.rcs.revma.com/x8wbda03tm0uv?rj-ttl=5&rj-tok=AAABk1OdfM0Ag3nPpcK5MnoE6A](https://n39a-eu.rcs.revma.com/x8wbda03tm0uv?rj-ttl=5&rj-tok=AAABk1OdfM0Ag3nPpcK5MnoE6A)

Music from popular children’s movies (such as Disney)–includes covers, not just the originals.  

Other Fun Kids station links can be found at the [Yoto Live! database](http://www.yoto.live/index.asp)

### Sorcerer Radio (Disney music)

A collection of Disney fan stations. I have links for three of them

Main station:  [https://26343.live.streamtheworld.com/SAM05AAC015_SC  
](https://26343.live.streamtheworld.com/SAM05AAC015_SC)Plays music from Disney movies and parks. At night they play sleep music as well I believe.

Sorcerer Radio Seasons:  [http://19003.live.streamtheworld.com/SP_R2809833_SC](http://19003.live.streamtheworld.com/SP_R2809833_SC)

I assume they play seasonally-appropriate music. Right now it’s Christmas music.

Sorcerer Radio Atmospheres: [http://14223.live.streamtheworld.com/SP_R3956612_SC](http://14223.live.streamtheworld.com/SP_R3956612_SC)

I thought this would be relaxation music, but as I’m skimming it to list here it’s played a pop song, then three movie-score-like instrumentals, so I honestly have no idea what this is at the moment. Perhaps this one is specifically music that plays in the parks? I’m not American so I wouldn’t know!

### Sleep Radio

(name unknown): [https://n04a-eu.rcs.revma.com/pp2cg1z3tm0uv?rj-ttl=5&rj-tok=AAABk1OsX3gASG26qjraDmwNLw](https://n04a-eu.rcs.revma.com/pp2cg1z3tm0uv?rj-ttl=5&rj-tok=AAABk1OsX3gASG26qjraDmwNLw)

Don’t know the name for this one, but it plays a variety of sleep music. This one does include specifically-child-centric songs like nursery rhymes/lullabies.

  
  

## Genre Radio

### Bossa Nova

Bossa Nova Hits:  [http://strm112.1.fm/bossanova_mobile_mp3](http://strm112.1.fm/bossanova_mobile_mp3)

Plays great bossa music, both instrumentals and vocals. I’ve never noticed any ads/callsigns, just music.

### Medieval Music

Ancient FM: [https://mediaserv73.live-streams.nl:18058/stream](https://mediaserv73.live-streams.nl:18058/stream)

Plays an excellent selection of medieval music, both vocal and instrumental. I listen to this one a lot it’s lovely.

  

### Yacht Rock/Dad Rock

Margaritaville Radio:  [http://radmarg.ic.llnwd.net/stream/radmarg_razorback](http://radmarg.ic.llnwd.net/stream/radmarg_razorback)

When I got my Yoto, the first thing my goofy uncle asked was “does it have Margaritaville radio?”. If you also have a goofy uncle, he’ll love to listen to this with your kids LOL.
