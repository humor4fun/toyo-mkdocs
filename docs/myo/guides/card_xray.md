# MYO Card X-ray

Just kidding! This is not a real x-ray. Did you know that by shining a bright light through the back side of a card you can see the electronics inside? 

## PSA: Don't punch holes in your cards.

1. It lowers the resale value
2. If you punch in the antenna or memory chip you will destroy the card making it useless.
3. If you punch outside the antenna, you're likely to create a plastic strip too thin to bear force and it will break off.
4. If you punch inside the antenna, force applied may cause the plastic to bend or break damaging or destroying the antenna.
