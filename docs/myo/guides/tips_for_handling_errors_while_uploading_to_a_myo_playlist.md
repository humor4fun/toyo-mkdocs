# Tips for Handling Errors While Uploading to a MYO Playlist

If you get an error when trying to upload files to the MYO playlist creator like `Failed to process file.` or `Make sure itâ€™s a valid MP3`, try these steps:

1. Log out and log back into the website
2. Open the playlist you were working on in a new tab
3. Create a new playlist and open it in a new tab
4. In your MYO list, delete the bugged playlist, and close that tab
5. Try to upload one file to your new playlist
6. Set a title for the new playlist, save and close the playlist
7. Open that saved playlist and edit it again to add all the rest of the tracks, description, card art, icons
