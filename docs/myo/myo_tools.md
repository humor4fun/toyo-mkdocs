# MYO Tools

*These are tools for making MYO that are not related to acquiring audio.*

[https://www.yotoicons.com/](https://www.yotoicons.com/) - A database of Yoto icons submitted by other Yoto users! Excellent if you need character-specific icons, which is not something offered in Yoto’s default icon selection.
  
[MYO Studio](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/myo-studio/olloopaapdodegpcacjmgdjaphggfgoj) - This is a browser extension for Chrome (unfortunately only Chrome) made specifically for use with the My Yoto space to improve the process of making MYO playlists. I don’t use Chrome so I haven’t been able to try it, but I know a lot of people really love it and swear by it! It adds some quality of life updates to My Yoto like searchable icons, automatically assigning icons, adding icons from yotoicons right in My Yoto space, etc. If you use Chrome for making your MYOs, do give it a look!

[Pixel It](https://giventofly.github.io/pixelit/) - Pixel It allows you to take an image and convert into pixel art. You can define the "pixel" size, create a pixel image using a color palette and also convert to a pixel grayscale image.
