# Using 3rd Party NFC Cards

The TOYO Team highly encourages individuals to purchase Official Yoto MYO cards for use with any MYO Playlist. Purchasing these Official cards helps support Yoto as a company by paying for hosting fees for all MYO Playlist content. Official MYO cards also offer the easiest, most user friendly process to link and use. However, TOYO recognizes that official Yoto MYO cards are often Out of Stock or that previously purchased cards may become lost or damaged. In light of that, we offer this guide on 3rd Party Alternative NFC Cards that can be used within the Yoto ecosystem.

----------

Certain 3rd Party NFC Cards can be used with Yoto Players, however, they require a slightly different - but still simple - linking process. This tutorial will teach you about that process and how to use 3rd Party NFC cards with your Yoto Player.
