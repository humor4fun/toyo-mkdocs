# The Vision

**A community built around high-quality-yoto-content and information sharing is what I'm here for.**

This project is collecting uploads from anyone who has **LEGAL BACKUPS** of their (presumably yoto-card-based) audio content.

If you are willing, please upload content into the designated folder. The project team will work on organizing and cataloging it to some extent. What extent? We don't know yet. At the very least it will be an index with links to the stuff.
