| Title | Unicorn (and Horse) |
| Author | David Miles |

Unicorn is a unicorn. And Horse is, well—not. Grab a pink cupcake and laugh along with this hilarious story about two very different animals—one seems magical and perfect, and the other—well, doesn't. But outside appearances don't always tell the whole story.
