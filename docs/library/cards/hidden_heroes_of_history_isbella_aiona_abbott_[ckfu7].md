A wave-splashing tale of the First Lady of Limu! Dive into the fascinating life of Isabella Aiona Abbott. From her early days in Hawaii to becoming a world-renowned expert on Pacific Ocean algae, her journey was filled with scientific curiosity and groundbreaking accomplishments. Drawing on the wisdom passed down through generations, she showed us how to connect with the natural world and use the oceans gifts for food and more. Ms. Abbott broke barriers by being the first Hawaiian woman to earn a PhD in science, discovering over 70 edible seaweeds, and leaving an enduring legacy in marine botany and Hawaiian ethnobotany.
