With Principal Zartan gone and the Lyre XR devices under control, everything seems safe in Springfield again. Now that the Anti-Venom Coalition has officially recruited Shana (aka Scarlett), she and the Average Joes feel readier than ever to take down Cobra for good.

They even have the Arashikages—an undercover clan of ninjas—in their corner. When the dojo is attacked and the ninjas are forced into hiding, Scarlett, Stan, and Julien are left to defend the town on their own. Not even Scarlett’s best friend, Ichi no Zoro-me, can help. With a militant principal installed at Springfield Academy, Scarlett does her best to uncover Cobra’s plans. But the deeper she digs, the more she discovers about the Arashikages’ true mission.

As Scarlett begins to question the ninjas’ intentions, she finds herself faced with an impossible decision. To save the innocent people of Springfield, will she have to stand up against her found family?
