| Author | London Rhymes |

**Description**:

_**Yoto says:** Sing and play all through your day with these fun pre-school songs from London Rhymes._

'Play all day' is all about songs that might help get you all through the day – from dawn till dusk! Written together with parents and tots on our projects around London, they are written in response to the realities of modern-day parenting, the highs and the lows. We've turned nappy changes, hand washing, bathtime, potty training and more into theme tunes to your day!

Track listing:  

Good morning!  
Wakey wakey  
I smile you smile  
The Nappy change song  
Play all day  
Copy me  
Its Nappy time  
How clean can you be?  
It’s great to wait  
Bathtime blues  
Splashin’ in the bath  
The Potty song
