| Title | The Pout-Pout Fish, Far, Far from Home |
| Author | Deborah Diesen |

**Description**:

Mr. Fish has prepped and packed,
And he’s made big plans to roam.
He’s ready for adventure
On his trip away from home!

But sometimes trips have detours
And not everything goes right.
Without his favorite toy,
Can he fall asleep at night?

Mr. Fish has prepped and packed,
And he’s made big plans to roam.
He’s ready for adventure
On his trip away from home!

But sometimes trips have detours
And not everything goes right.
Without his favorite toy,
Can he fall asleep at night?

Swim along with Mr. Fish as he explores new places and meets new friends in The Pout-Pout Fish, Far, Far from Home. He might just learn that a few bumps along the way are all part of the journey. 

Deborah Diesen and Dan Hanna are back with everyone's favorite grumpy fish, to show that love doesn’t have to be packed, it travels with you always.
