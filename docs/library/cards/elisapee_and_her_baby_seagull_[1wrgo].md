| Title | Elisapee and Her Baby Seagull |
| Author | Nancy Mike |

**Description**:

When her father brings home a baby seagull, Elisapee falls in love with the tiny bird. She names it Nau (short for Naujaaraq). Elisapee and her brother feed Nau sculpins, seal fat, and small krill. Nau grows bigger, and her feathers turn white. Eventually, Elisapee and her brother teach Nau to fly. To be sure they know which bird is theirs, Elisapee ties a pink bow onto Nau’s leg. Every day, Nau flies with the other seagulls, then comes back to sleep on the roof of Elisapee’s shed. But then, one day, Nau is ready to leave home for good. Will Elisapee have to say a final goodbye? Or will Nau’s spirit and memory live on, no matter where the arctic winds lead her?
