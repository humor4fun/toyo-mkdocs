| Title | Goodnight Mister Tom |
| Author | Michelle Magorian |

**Description**:

_**Yoto says: Follow Willie's journey as he's evacuated to the countryside during the Second World War and makes an unlikely friend.**_

Brought to you by Puffin. Goodnight Mister Tom is the unforgettable story of young Willie Beech, evacuated to the country as Britain stands on the brink of the Second World War. A sad, deprived child, he slowly begins to flourish under the unlikely care of grumpy old Tom Oakley. But then his new-found happiness is shattered by a summons from his mother to come back to London. As the weeks pass by Tom begins to worry when William doesn't answer his letters, so he goes to London to find him, and there makes a terrible discovery.

_A Note From Yoto_: A compelling story set in World War II, Goodnight Mister Tom deals with themes of death and grief and might not be suitable for sensitive listeners.
