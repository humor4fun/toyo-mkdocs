| Title | The Book of Arralan: Bedtime Stories, Volume 1 |
| Author | Morwenna Rose |

**Description**:

Because The Book of Arralan is sometimes a little too exciting to make its listeners sleepy at bedtime, we have written and composed seven new sleep stories. 

Each story contains music, sound effects, and a guided visualisation with some of your favorite characters and places in Arralan. When the narration is done we’ve included 8-10 minutes of music to help listeners fall asleep. 

The Book of Arralan: Bedtime Stories - Volume 1 includes 7 stories, one for each night of the week:

1. A Visit to the Kinder Kingdom.
In this story, I’d like to invite you to imagine what it would be like if you visited Arralan. We visit the Kinder Kingdom and do some gardening and baking with Kester.

2. Life on the Seas With the Galley Girls. 
In this story, we are going to visit Erin and the Galley Girls. We will swim, do chores, and play games on the Galliana, and if we’re lucky, we might see something very special.

3. A Rumple Celebration. 
It’s a special time of year in the Rumple Warrens. I'd love to take you there to show you what they are doing, and how they celebrate this occasion.

4. Helping Zula. 
In this story, I'd like to invite you to Zula’s yard. She has a little creature that needs rescuing and I know she will struggle to do it alone.

5. Riding with Lilac
Have you ever imagined going on a unicorn ride? Well, in this story, you can see exactly what it would be like to spend the day with Lilac and her Unicorn friends. 

6. A play with Sniz and Snoz
Have you ever wondered what Sniz and Snoz get up to on a regular day? On a day when they are not out on a big adventure? In this story, you can visit them and spend the day playing and having fun in the Red Lands.
 
7. A Day with the Grass People
It's harvest time at the village in the Grass Lands and they want to invite you to join in.
