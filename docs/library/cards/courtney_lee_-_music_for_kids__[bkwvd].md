| Title | Courtney Lee - Music for Kids! |
| Author | Courtney Lee |

**Description**:

Join Courtney Lee on a musical adventure! We’ll try new things, visit the ice cream shop, travel to space, and so much more. Each song will have you dancing, laughing, imagining, and, of course, singing! 

While each song has a different focus and style, Courtney Lee’s quirky lyrics invites kids to be immersed in the fun of music while also engaging their imaginations as she sings about topics relatable to everyone like trying new foods or getting ready for the day. These songs were made for the infant to the great-grandparent—everyone can enjoy Courtney Lee!  Courtney Lee writes songs for kids about all kinds of things—and they all come to life in a whimsical way with her unique lyrics and music! 

Courtney is a firm believer that music should never be boring, so she incorporates lots of different styles in her music for kids including Latin jazz, pop, acoustic, rap, and more. A mom to three kids, she started writing songs when her kids were young to help them understand the world better. That songwriting has turned into musical joy that has now spread to kids all over the world! 

“Sing a song along with me!” 
-Courtney Lee
