A rhyming re-imagining of Tom Fletcher's bestselling story The Christmasaurus; a book full of festive fun!  
  
Santa and his reindeer live as North as you can go,  
in a place that's full of magic (and quite a lot of snow!).  
But Santa and his reindeer do not live there on their own,  
for there's a special dinosaur that also calls it home...  
  
The Christmasaurus wants more than anything to be able to fly, and help pull Santa's sleigh across the sky at Christmas-time. But flying turns out to be a lot harder than he thought, even with Santa's help! One special Christmas, however, he falls down a chimney and meets a dinosaur-obsessed little boy who teaches him the magic of believing...  
  
Tom Fletcher has stunningly reimagined his original Christmasaurus story for younger listeners, packed full of festive fun, heartwarming moments, and clever rhyme.
