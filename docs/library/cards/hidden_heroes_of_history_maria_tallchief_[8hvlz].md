**Description**:

A head-twirling tale of fairies, firebirds and en pointe feats! Maria Tallchief is a trailblazing dancer who leapt into fame to become America’s first Prima Ballerina. Her technical precision and unique style of dance—full of energy, speed and passion—put American ballet on the map. Early in her career, she was told to change her last name, but Ms. Tallchief refused to hide her Native American heritage and Osage roots. Her successful dance career and worldwide adoration proved the naysayers wrong!
