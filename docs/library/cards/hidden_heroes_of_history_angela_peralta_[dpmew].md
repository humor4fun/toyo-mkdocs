| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

¡La historia del ruiseñor mexicano! Beloved for her remarkable Bel Canto singing style, Ángela Peralta became known the world over as “The Mexican Nightingale.” She made her debut at the young age of 15, rising in demand to appear at leading opera houses throughout Mexico, Italy, France, Spain, Russia, Egypt and the United States. Beyond singing, Ms. Peralta also wrote and composed her own music and boldly started her own opera company. Like the audiences who loved her, we stand up and cheer “¡Bravo, Ángela Peralta, Bravo!"
