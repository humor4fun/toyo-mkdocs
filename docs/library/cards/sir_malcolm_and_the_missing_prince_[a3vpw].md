**Description**:

_**From the Creator: Join Sir Malcolm as he encounters a battle raging in the heart of his king.**_

Meet [**Lamplighter Theatre**](/creators/lamplighter-theatre "Lamplighter Theatre profile page"). 

Prince Hubert, proven to be an unworthy heir, will destroy the kingdom if allowed to rise to power. Through the bold intervention of the king’s most trusted knight, Sir Malcolm, a plan to teach the prince a lesson he will never forget is about to unfold.

Before the plan can be carried out however, Sir Malcolm must convince the king that his plan is for the greater good of both his son and the kingdom. As the plot thickens, far from the safety of the palace, Hubert now known as Hugh, has exchanged his princely apparel for rags, leaving all his royal advantages behind.

In a remote village where people work to eat, Hugh must learn that the requirement for kingship is sacrifice and servanthood. It is with great enthusiasm and anticipation that we introduce to you Sir Malcolm and the Missing Prince, an exhilarating and suspenseful masterpiece.
