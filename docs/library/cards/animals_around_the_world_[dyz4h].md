**Description**:

_**Yoto says:**This play-along audio card pack takes listeners on a wondrous wildlife adventure._

 Animals Around the World encourages kids to explore their imaginations and creativity as they learn about wildlife from all corners of the globe. The pack contains seven LEGO® DUPLO® Yoto Cards full of songs, activities, soundscapes and a story to explore the wonderful world of animals in fun and engaging ways.

This audio pack can be enjoyed on its own and has also been specially designed to be enhanced by the LEGO DUPLO World Animals set, sold separately.

Includes seven original audio cards:

Animal Jams - Sing and dance with the animals with five tracks inspired by the World Animals sett. Includes Five Little Monkeys, All Around the World, Itsy Bitsy Spider and two brand new original Yoto songs: Petra the Penguin, and Pete the Parrot.

Animal Rescue Adventure - An exciting play-along story. Join the animal rescue squad, who are here to lend a hand, as they help creatures big and small in forest, sea or sand. Sound Explorers - Four immersive soundscapes for creative play. Escape with your animals to the Arctic, the savanna, the jungle and the ocean.

Animal Sounds – Identify animal sounds! Listen closely to see if you can tell which animals are making these sounds. BZZZZZ… Was that a bee or an elephant?!

Animal Parade – Play like the animals! Get ready to get up and get moving like the animals. Can you stretch up high like a giraffe, or gallop like a horse? Animal Riddles – Learn about animals! Listen to the clues and see if you can crack these animal riddles. Which animal hibernates for the winter?

Make Your Own - Build your own adventure, make your own activity, sing your own song, and more with this blank card designed to be filled with any audio you like. Use your bricks to inspire you - a whole world of audio is yours to explore!
