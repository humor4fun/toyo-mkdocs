**Description**:

Join our intrepid adventurers Otto and Cassandra (and Missy, the smartest bird in the Universe) as they embark on a brand new Ladybird Audio Adventure! 

In this adventure Cassandra and Missy are off to experience the incredible world of the creepy crawlies. Did you know that there are over a million different insects in the World? Cassandra is going to need to fire up her Shrink-O-Meter to discover the fascinating life of some of the world's smallest animals. Now, follow that bee!

These audiobooks help children learn about their environment on journey of discovery with the narrators Ben Bailey Smith (aka Doc Brown, rapper, comedian and writer) and Sophie Aldred (best known for her role as Ace in Doctor Who).

Ladybird Audio Adventures is an original series for four-to seven-year-olds; a new, entertaining and engaging way for children to learn about the world around them. These are special stories written exclusively for audio with fun sound and musical effects, perfect for listening at home, before bed and on long journeys. 

Shortlisted for the Best Children's Audiobook at the New York Festival Radio Awards 2020.
