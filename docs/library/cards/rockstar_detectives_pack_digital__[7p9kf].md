**Description**:

_**Yoto Says: Join Charley and George on three of their exciting adventures as they solve mysteries!**_

Brought to you by Puffin.  

Dive into the fabulously funny and thrilling world of Charley and George with this bundle of three novels from comedian Adam Hills. Perfect for fans of Sharna Jackson, Robin Stevens, David Baddiel, and David O'Doherty, these stories are packed with mystery, humor, and high-stakes adventures.  

**Rockstar Detectives**

When a priceless painting goes missing, Charley - a 12-year-old viral singing sensation - and her best friend George - camera whizz and budding comedian - are shocked to discover they're the prime suspects. Now Charley and George have to prove they're not international criminals - all while nailing a stellar European tour and keeping up with their homework! But as news of high-profile heists hits the headlines wherever they go, Charley and George keep finding themselves in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Can they solve these baffling crimes and save themselves, or will their shot for stardom be over almost as soon as it's begun?  

**Rockstar Detectives: Murder at the Movies**  

Charley and George are in Sydney, where Charley is filming her first movie. But when mysterious accidents begin to happen whenever Charley's on set, the duo suspect someone isn't as excited about her big screen debut as they are... No one else seems to believe that Charley's in real danger - and from the bad-tempered director to Charley's rude co-star, anyone could be a suspect. Can the detective dream team solve their second mystery, wrap the movie - and keep Charley in one piece?"  

**Rockstar Detectives: Trouble at the Track**  

This summer, Charley and George are in Paris to perform at the biggest sporting championships in the world, but soon after their arrival they notice one of the star athletes, Alfie Eagles, has gone missing. Has he dropped out? Is it sabotage? Or is it something more sinister all together . . . ? With the big race fast approaching, it’s a race against time for the Rockstar Detectives to crack the case and find the missing athlete before it’s too late!
