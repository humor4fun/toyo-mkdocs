| Title | The Day Punctuation Came to Town |
| Author | Kimberlee Gard |

**Description**:

A new family has moved to Alphabet City—the Punctuations! It’s the first day at a new school for Exclamation Point, Question Mark, Period, and Comma. As the letters in school begin forming words, the Punctuations join in the fun. Exclamation Point adds excitement to the words! Question Mark helps the words ask questions. Period brings a nice stop to things. But, Comma isn’t sure how he fits in. He can’t help but feel like he’s just getting in the way and slowing things down. Do the letters even need Comma? What would happen if he wasn’t around?
