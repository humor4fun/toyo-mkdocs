| Title | Hidden Heroes of History: Maya Lin |
| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

Uncover the life of Maya Lin, the visionary artist and architect behind one of the most visited memorials in America. Her parents were Chinese immigrants, both accomplished in their own artistic fields. Growing up, they supported her pursuits and encouraged her to always follow her passions. At just 21, Maya won a national design competition to create the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C—a reflective black granite wall engraved with the names of fallen soldiers. Throughout her career, Maya Lin continues to have an impact on important social and environmental issues through her work. That’s the power of her art!
