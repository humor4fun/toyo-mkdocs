| Author | Janay Brown-Wood |

**Description**:

**Yoto says:** This magical tale with roots in the tradition of adumu-a cultural jumping dance-is a spirited girl’s inspiring story.

“Imani the tiny” the children tease her, but this young Maasai girl is determined to touch the moon. Her mother shares stories of others who have overcome challenges and managed great accomplishments always reminding Imani that “it is only you who must believe.”

This magical read-along tale, with roots in the tradition of the adumu, a cultural jumping dance, is one strong and spirited girl’s thrilling story.
