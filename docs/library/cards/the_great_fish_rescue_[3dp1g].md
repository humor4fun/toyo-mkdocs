Zak and Sami need to find more water fast, even if the adults don’t seem to care. Everyone needs somewhere safe to live – don’t they?

Perfect for children age 6+ who enjoy a longer listen with chapters. The Cheeky Frog Series is aimed at thoughtful listeners who love animals.

These titles offer engaging, relatable stories of children helping animals in trouble, while gently exploring contemporary social issues like poverty and discrimination.
