**Description**:

_**Yoto says:** A smart girl with a can-do attitude, Dyamonde Daniel is always ready to help a friend in need. And when she is on the case, things usually get done!_

Dyamonde has just moved to a new school, and she’s impatient for a best friend. Then Free shows up, and there’s an even newer kid in class. Unfortunately, Free doesn’t want to be friends. In fact, he’s downright grouchy. Dyamonde is determined to find out what’s bothering him. And when Dyamonde Daniel decides to do something, it usually gets done!
