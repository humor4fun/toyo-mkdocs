| Title | Get Me Out Of Here |
| Author | Andy Mcnab; Phil Earle |

**Description**:

_**Yoto says**: Danny and his mates head out on a school trip like no other in this laugh-out-loud adventure._

Best-selling Andy McNab and award-winning Phil Earle join forces for the very first time, and the results are hilarious!

Danny Mack's mates are brilliant: there's his best mate Giraffles (yeh, you read that right), so-called because of his unusually long neck; the MandM twins (you got it - like the chocolate) who are always finishing each other's sentences; and Lucky Success, who, well I reckon you can guess how he got his name.

They're the best mates a kid could ask for, and when an epic school trip is announced, they're all properly made up about it. Because school trips are just an excuse to have a big laugh with your mates, right? Erm, wrong.

Let's just say that this is a school trip like no other, and Danny, Giraffles, Lucky and the MandMs have got a real challenge on their hands.

Will they make it through? If Danny has anything to do with it, you bet they will!
