**Description**:

_**Yoto says: Join Evan on his journey to become a Dream Breacher as he learns that any dream can become true if you put your mind to it.**_

When a tween boy discovers that he has the ability to move freely between the world of dreams and reality, he quickly finds himself living a nightmare. Evan Rickert has always had vivid dreams but the one he has on the eve of his 12th birthday—in which his parents give him a dog named Luna—feels especially real. So when he wakes up and realizes it was just a dream, disappointment sets in. But not for long. Because, wait…what’s that barking? Luna’s in his room! So, it wasn’t a dream? With the help of his friends, a reappearing stranger and a mysterious organization called the Dream Academy, Evan must confront his greatest fears to discover what it means to be a Dream Breacher.
