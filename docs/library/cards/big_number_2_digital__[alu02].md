**Description**:

_**Yoto Says: The Nanasis is back! Join Matt and Rich on this hilarious adventure to free Vanessa, Nan's pet ferret, and more!**_

THE EVIL NANASIS has gone REALLY bananas this time and WANTS HER STUFF BACK or the world is doomed (again). Worst of all, she's holding Nan's beloved pet ferret hostage! This time the POO-NAMI is really going to hit the wind farm!    

Against all the odds, it's up to the Listies to save the day . . . Next stop in the interdimensional plumbing of time and space is THE MAUL, a sinister shopping centre that's surprisingly difficult to leave. Let's hope they don't SHOP TILL THEY DROP!

**The "Big Number 2" physical card will arrive to Yoto in January 2025.**
