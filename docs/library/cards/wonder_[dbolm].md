**Description**:

_**Yoto says:** Discover the unforgettable story of Auggie, a boy who was desperate to blend in but was destined to stand out._

Brought to you by Penguin. The award-winning, multi-million copy bestselling phenomenon that is WONDER, now narrated by an all-kid cast.

'My name is August. I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.' Auggie wants to be an ordinary ten-year-old. He does ordinary things - eating ice cream, playing on his Xbox. He feels ordinary - inside. But ordinary kids don't make other ordinary kids run away screaming in playgrounds. Ordinary kids aren't stared at wherever they go. Born with a terrible facial abnormality, Auggie has been home-schooled by his parents his whole life.

Now, for the first time, he's being sent to a real school - and he's dreading it. All he wants is to be accepted - but can he convince his new classmates that he's just like them, underneath it all?
