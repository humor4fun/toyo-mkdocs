Junkyard Tales: All Together Now: Dancing on a Bridge: It is a very hot day at the Junkyard, and the animals are out of sorts. No one seems to be able to get along! By dusk, when the Rowlands (a family of raccoons) makes their nightly visit, they can smell the conflict in the air. Luckily Roger Rowland has an idea that might help...

At Home with Martin & Sylvia: The Grumpy Day: It is a big gardening day, and everyone in Martin and Sylvia's family is feeling grumpy. The air seems heavy and hot and sticky, and brother and sister don't want to work. Daddy can't find his belt, and Momma is concerned about the weather. What are they to do? When the sky darkens and it starts to rain, everyone scrambles to finish the gardening. But with the pouring rain, and some family silliness, they find that their grumpies are washed away.

Libby & Dish: Upside Down and Rightside Up: When Libby’s mother experiences a difficult day, Libby is determined to help set things right. But after things go awry, Dish offers a suggestion that might bring balance to the whole family.
