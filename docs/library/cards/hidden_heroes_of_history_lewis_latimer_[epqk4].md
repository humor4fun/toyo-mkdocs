**Description**:

A story of innovation and self-determination! Lewis Latimer was an American inventor, patent draftsman and artist whose work included the detailed drawings for Alexander Graham Bell’s telephone. He improved Thomas Edison’s light bulb so it could last longer and be accessible to more homeowners. He earned seven patents for his own inventions that helped people with their day-to-day lives and, in his personal life, he enjoyed painting, playing the flute and creative writing. Lewis Latimer left behind a brighter world for us all.
