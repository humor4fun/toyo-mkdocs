**Description**:

_**Yoto says: Join Zelli Stormclash and the Danger Club in magical adventures at the Dungeon Academy!**_

**Dungeons & Dragons: Dungeon Academy: No Humans Allowed:**

Welcome to Dungeon Academy, where monsters and creatures train for the dark world that awaits just beyond the dungeon walls.  But Zellidora "Zelli" Stormclash isn't a monster or a creature. She is something far worse. Zelli is a human. Disguised as a minotaur, Zelli keeps to herself and does her work. While in class, Zelli learns of the great human adventurer, Allidora Steelstrike, who oddly resembles her. Could Zelli also be a Steelstrike?  Seeking answers to her true lineage, Zelli embarks on a dangerous adventure. But she won't be alone. A vegan owlbear, a cowardly kobold, and a shapeshifting mimic will join Zelli on her quest for truth. And who knows, perhaps these monstrous misfits may discover truths of their own...

**Dungeons & Dragons: Dungeon Academy: Tourney of Terror:**

Something BIG has come knocking on the gates of Dungeon Academy!  The undefeated Waterdeep Dragons have arrived for the Tourney of Terror games, which occur every half century. The Academy Flumphs are outnumbered, outsized, and outmonstered.  But our hero, Zelli Stormclash-a forbidden human, secretly disguised as a minotaur-is no stranger to impossible odds, and neither are her friends, the Danger Club, who recently battled a necromancer and his army of undead!  If the Waterdeep Dragons weren't enough to raise scales, Zelli's recurring nightmare of a dark entity annihilating her world may be more than just a bad dream. Something sinister lurks in the halls of the school, and only Zelli seems to notice.  But when Zelli uncovers a dark past hidden deep beneath Dungeon Academy, she unlocks something that will endanger her school, the tournament, and everything within the Forgotten Realms.

**Dungeons & Dragons; Dungeon Academy: Last Best Hope**:

Zelli Stormclash and the Danger Club have only one goal: save their friend Bauble from the evil clutches of Elgred Morbide. There’s only one problem—the evil machinations of Morbide’s selfish plots have come to a head, and the final battle for Dungeon Academy has already begun. Deep beneath the desert, a monstrous dracolich is about to be unleashed, an evil, undead dragon bent on revenge against everything in her path.  
Zelli is no longer on a rescue mission but a fated quest to save Dungeon Academy, Faerun, and all the Forgotten Realms. Our motley crew of heroes must rise to the occasion and wield the most important weapon an adventurer can carry: hope. Against impossible odds, the Danger Club—members old and new—must take one last stand together and fight like never before . . . till the very end.
