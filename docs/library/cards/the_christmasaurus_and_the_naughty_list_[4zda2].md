| Author | Tom Fletcher |

**Description**:

_**Yoto says:** There will be no naughty list this year if the Christmasaurus has any say! The third story in the Christmasaurus series._  

You know about the Naughty and Nice List, right? Santa's top-secret tracker that he ALWAYS checks twice? Well, this year, the Christmasaurus is on a mission to track down children who have found themselves on the Naughty List to help them put wrongs to rights and naughty to nice!  
  
This is a story about mischievous kids learning the error of their ways, but it's also about sharing the true spirit of Christmas and realising that sometimes things aren't quite as they first appear...
