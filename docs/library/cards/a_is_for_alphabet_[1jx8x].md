**Description**:

_**Yoto Says**: This play-along audio card pack brings letters to life for young learners._

A is for Alphabet encourages kids to explore their imaginations and creativity as they learn the alphabet. The pack contains seven LEGO® DUPLO® Yoto Cards full of songs, activities, soundscapes and a story which bring letters to life in fun and engaging ways.  
  
This audio pack can be enjoyed on its own and has also been specially designed to be enhanced by the LEGO DUPLO Alphabet Truck, sold separately.  
  
Includes seven original audio cards:  
  
**1. M is for Music** - Sing and dance your way to learning the alphabet with five tracks inspired by the Alphabet Truck. Includes The Alphabet Song, The Truck Song and 3 brand new original Yoto songs: The Alphabet Highway, The Letter Song, and What Does This Spell?  
  
**2. ABC Delivery** - An exciting play-along story. Hop aboard the Alphabet Truck with Alina and Sam as they try to collect all the letters for the most important delivery of all - the alphabet!  
  
**3. Sound Explorers** - Four immersive soundscapes for creative play. Escape with your truck to the city, the countryside, the motorway, and the seaside.  
  
**4. Letter Learners** - Learn initial letter sounds! Discover which sound each letter makes, and hear which sounds come at the beginning of a word. Do you know which sound 'cat' starts with?  
  
**5. Word Detectives** - Practise letter sounds! Use your bricks and play-along to practise which sound each letter makes. Can you think of some words that begin with that sound?  
  
**6. Alphabet Builders** - Learn the alphabet! Listen along and find the matching letters in your bricks as you learn the alphabet. Can you build up your truck from A to Z, ready for delivery?  
  
**7. Make Your Own** - Build your own adventure, make your own activity, sing your own song, and more with this blank card designed to be filled with any audio you like. Use your bricks to inspire you - a whole world of audio is yours to explore!
