| Title | Hidden Heroes of History: Hedy Lamarr |
| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

The Dorktales Broadcasting System presents a Tinseltown tale of scientific experiments and world-changing inventions! Who knew that Hollywood’s famous film star in the 1930’s was one of the most brilliant minds of her time? Adored by the public as “the most beautiful woman in the world,” Hedy Lamarr’s real talent was technological innovation and invention—from light up dog collars to aircraft wing design! But her most extraordinary achievement was the frequency-hopping technology she developed in the 1940s. It is the foundation of every cell phone, GPS, Bluetooth and wi-fi network in use today.
