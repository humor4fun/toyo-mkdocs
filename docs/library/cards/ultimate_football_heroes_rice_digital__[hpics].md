When Declan Rice was released by Chelsea's youth academy at the age of 14, he was devastated. But he wasn't going to let that get in the way of his Premier League dreams. He worked harder than ever, and by the time he was 20, he was the captain and star of top-flight West Ham. Discover how the two-footed, high energy, combative midfielder established himself as an irreplaceable member of the England national team and Arsenal's new record signing.  

Ultimate Football Heroes is a series of biographies telling the life stories of the biggest and best footballers in the world and their incredible journeys from childhood fan to superstar professional player. Written in fast-paced, action-packed style these audiobooks are perfect for all the family to collect and share.
