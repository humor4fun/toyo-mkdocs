**Description**:

_**Yoto says: Join Lottie on a secondary school adventure filled with friendship, embarrassing moments and plenty of lols.**_

Brought to you by Puffin. The first book in the hilarious series for children by the bestselling author, Katie Kirby. Lottie Brooks is 11 ¾ and her life is already officially over - not only is she about to start high school without any friends or glamorous swooshy hair, she's just discovered she's too flat-chested to wear A BRA! She might as well give up now and go into hibernation with her hamsters Sir Barnaby Squeakington and Fuzzball the Third. Lottie navigates the many perils of growing up in this fantastically funny series for a 9-12 audience, filled with friendship, embarrassing moments and plenty of lols. Hilarious, relatable and full of heart, for fans of funny and chaotic family stories.
