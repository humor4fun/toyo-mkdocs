| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

A tale that leads to an extinct volcano’s summit! Evelyn Cheesman’s deep love of the natural world led her to becoming the first woman curator at the London Zoo and leading entomologist for the Natural History Museum. From 1923 to 1953, she traveled to remote locations on solo-expeditions (unheard of for a woman at the time) where she observed, collected and catalogued previously undiscovered insects, reptiles, amphibians, and plants—over 70,000 of them! Scientists are still identifying new species from the specimens she discovered over 40 years ago.
