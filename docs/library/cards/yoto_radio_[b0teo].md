**Description**:

Yoto Kids Radio is curated and programmed by the Yoto team and aims to bring you the best in music for children (and adults) from pop to classics and from nursery rhymes to classical. The radio station playlist changes according to the time of day so expect more relaxing music around bedtime for example. It's a pretty eclectic mix of music - from Katy Perry to Disney and to the Nutcracker Suite. The radio playlist will also change seasonally.
