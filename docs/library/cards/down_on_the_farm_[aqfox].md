**Description**:

_**Yoto says:** Squelch, sing and dance around the farmyard with this baaah-mazing play-along adventure. Can you tell your moo from your oink?_

Down on the Farm encourages kids to use their imagination as they discover all the fun of the farmyard. The pack contains seven LEGO® DUPLO® Yoto Cards full of songs, activities, soundscapes and a story to learn all about life on the farm in fun and engaging ways.

This audio pack can be enjoyed on its own and has also been specially designed to be enhanced by the LEGO DUPLO Barn, Tractor and Farm Animal Care set, sold separately.

Includes seven original audio cards:

Tractor Tunes – Sing and dance your way around the farmyard with five tracks inspired by the Barn, Tractor and Farm Animal Care set. Includes Old MacDonald, B-I-N-G-O, The Farmer in the Dell, and two brand new original Yoto songs: Farm Life and Here’s What You Need To Do.

Farmyard Helpers – An exciting play-along story. Join Theo and Lola as they help out at Auntie Kate’s farm. Collecting chicken eggs and sweeping up cow poo? Nothing’s too much for the farmyard helpers!

Sound Explorers – Four immersive soundscapes for creative play. Escape with your bricks to discover early mornings on the farm, a farmer’s market, harvest sounds, and feeding time for the animals!

Farmyard Sounds – Identify farm sounds! Listen closely to see if you can tell which farmyard sound you’re hearing – from the baah of a sheep to the sound of a boot squelching in mud!

Farmyard Riddles – Learn about the farm! Listen to the clues and see if you can crack these farm riddles. Which animal makes the milk you pour on your cereal?

Farmyard Quiz – Counting and colour practice! Use farmyard fun to practice early learning skills. How many buttons are on the farmers shirt? And what colour is the barn?

MYO – Build your own adventure, make your own activity, sing your own song, and more with this blank card designed to be filled with any audio you like. Use your bricks to inspire you - a whole world of audio is yours to explore!
