| Title | The Thing About Bees |
| Author | Shabazz Larkin |

**Description**:

_Yoto says: A beautiful exploration about what bees mean to the world._

Shabazz Larkin’s The Thing About Bees is a Norman Rockwell-inspired Sunday in the park, a love poem from a father to his two sons, and a tribute to the bees that pollinate the foods we love to eat. Children are introduced to different kinds of bees, “how not to get stung,” and how the things we fear are often things we don’t fully understand.
