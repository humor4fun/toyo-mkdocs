**Description**:

_**Yoto says: Join your favorite Sparkle Stories characters in three enchanting holiday stories.**_

**A Frosty Walk**: Step into the enchanting world of "A Frosty Walk," a whimsical tale from the "At Home with Martin and Sylvia" collection! Join the adventure of the siblings Martin and Sylvia who awaken one magical morning to find their yard transformed into an ethereal wonderland adorned with glistening frost crystals. When Daddy takes them on a walk to their neighbor's house, they discover Jack Frost's work along the sides of the brook, on the tips of every branch, and especially at the edges of a pond. They are so grateful for the beauty and wonder, that they decide to give the frost fairies a gift of their own making. They set out to craft a heartfelt and whimsical present, eager to give back to the magical spirits who've woven such wonder into their lives.

**Traditions**: Come along with us in the heartwarming story 'Traditions' from the beloved 'Junkyard Tales' collection. One morning Ben Thompson, clever cat, wakes to the sound of small scuffling feet. What could it be? Turns out it's three small mice, hunting for hidden glass stars. Glass stars? Ben later discovers that hiding colorful glass stars for the mice to find is one of the many holiday traditions in the Junkyard. There's also storytelling and gift-giving among others! It all sounds great to Ben; he wants to hide stars and tell stories and make gifts! But how can he possibly do it all? Listen along as Sergeant, the steadfast watchdog, helps Ben realize what is truly important about holiday traditions.

**A Little Bit of Light**: Tune in and become a part of the radiant story of "A Little Bit of Light" from the joyful collection, "Martin and Sylvia: More Adventures!" Every year when the trees have all lost their leaves and the ground starts to frost in the morning, brother and sister start to make their lanterns for their annual lantern festival. This year they can't go their normal route and need to choose another place to walk. When Martin suggests going next door to visit the doctor's house, Sylvia worries...
