**Description**:

Come along with us in the heartwarming story 'Traditions' from the beloved 'Junkyard Tales' collection. One morning Ben Thompson, clever cat, wakes to the sound of small scuffling feet. What could it be? Turns out it's three small mice, hunting for hidden glass stars. Glass stars? Ben later discovers that hiding colorful glass stars for the mice to find is one of the many holiday traditions in the Junkyard. There's also storytelling and gift-giving among others! It all sounds great to Ben; he wants to hide stars and tell stories and make gifts! But how can he possibly do it all? Listen along as Sergeant, the steadfast watchdog, helps Ben realize what is truly important about holiday traditions.
