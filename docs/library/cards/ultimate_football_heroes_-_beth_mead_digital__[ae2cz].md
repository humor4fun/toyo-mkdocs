As an energetic six-year-old, Beth Mead was taken to a weekly local football session by her mum. Finding a passion for the game, Beth often found herself as the only girl on the team. Despite being laughed at for this, she let her natural talent do the talking. At 16, Mead was signed to Sunderland where she made a name for herself as a top goalscorer. Putting off offers from Arsenal until she completed her university degree, Mead continued juggling work, study and football until she graduated. She then signed to Arsenal and earned a place as a Lioness, representing the England national team.

Discover how this talented forward balanced her university degree alongside a burgeoning football career to hone her skills. From becoming captain of her primary school's boys team to being announced as the youngest winner of the Women's Super League Golden Boot and being named as the Player of the Tournament at the UEFA Women's Euro 2022 tournament.

Ultimate Football Heroes is a series of biographies telling the life stories of the biggest and best footballers in the world and their incredible journeys from childhood fan to superstar professional player. Written in fast-paced, action-packed style these audiobooks are perfect for all the family to collect and share.
