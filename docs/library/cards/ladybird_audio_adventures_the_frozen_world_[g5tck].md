Join our intrepid adventurers Otto and Cassandra (and Missy, the smartest bird in the Universe) as they embark on a brand new Ladybird Audio Adventure!

In this adventure, Otto and Missy are off to explore the Frozen World. Setting course for the Arctic and Antarctica they discover penguins, orcas and seals, and a whole lot of snow! Now if they can just figure out how to get the heating going in Otto's teleporter they'll be able to get back home!
