| Title | The Story Seeds Podcast |
| Author | Literary Safari |

**Description**:

The Story Seeds Podcast matches children ages 6-12 and their story ideas with popular and best-selling children's book authors. Hosted by children's book author and librarian Betsy Bird, each episode follows a unique collaboration as authors and kids meet up to grow an original story. The author always reads the completed story at the end, which brings a relaxing storytime feel to the close of each episode. This podcast is a Common Sense Media Selection and Webby Award nominee, and its catchy theme song is composed by Andrew VanWyngarden of MGMT fame. For the creative rockstar in your home, the podcast has also published a companion activity book, Imagination Lab: Experiments in Creativity, which pairs listening, reading, writing, and maker activities.
