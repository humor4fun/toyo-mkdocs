| Author | Divinity Roxx |

**Description**:

_**Yoto says:** Rock out and get funky with these joyful tunes, equal parts fun and empowering and full of encouraging messages for kids._

Divinity Roxx is an American recording artist, composer, and musician. In addition to her own work, she is well known for touring and performing with Beyoncé Knowles (2006–2011) as her bassist and Musical Director.

'Ready Set Go' is her latest family-focused album. These tunes are equal parts fun and empowering and encourage kids to prepare themselves for greatness from the moment the day begins. Whether getting ready for school or just getting ready to try something new, being prepared is the first step to accomplishing anything. The next steps, Divinity says, are to put on a smile, add a dash of confidence, the right attitude, and then you’re ready to go!
