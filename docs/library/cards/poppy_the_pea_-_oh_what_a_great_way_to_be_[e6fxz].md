| Title | Poppy the Pea - Oh, what a great way to be |
| Author | Dr Fuzz |

**Description**:

Meet Poppy the Pea... she’s “one of a kind, the most unlikely Pea you’re likely to find.”

Poppy lives with her fellow peas "in the dark and freezy degrees". She dreams of being bold and free to explore the outside world, but one irrational and overwhelming fear stands in her way. Can this sweet little pea ever be bold and break free? 

Join Poppy as she engages with fear, setbacks, and wise characters on her first and formative adventure! This is the first title in an inspiring new rhyming book series following the adventures of Poppy the Pea - now brought beautifully to life through the warm and engaging voice of actress Julia Savill, along with fun sound effects and music that will entertain listeners young and old. 

This audiobook is a perfect accompaniment to the Poppy the Pea hardback or eBook, and is suitable for children aged five onwards: with playful rhyming verse and catchy refrains that convey a variety of discussion points and life lessons. The division of the story into five very short chapters also introduces emergent listeners to a more structured format. 

Poppy the Pea - Oh, what a great way to be is a charming and inspirational short tale centred around an endearing female character, with universal themes of bravery, resilience, friendship and hope that will appeal to all genders and ages.
