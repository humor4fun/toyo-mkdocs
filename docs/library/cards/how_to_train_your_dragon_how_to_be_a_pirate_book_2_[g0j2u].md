| Title | How to Train Your Dragon: How To Be A Pirate: Book 2 |
| Author | Cressida Cowell |

**Description**:

Listen to the books that inspired the How to Train Your Dragon films, narrated by David Tennant.  

THE STORY CONTINUES in the second volume of Hiccup's How to Train Your Dragon memoirs ...  Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III was an awesome sword-fighter, a dragon-whisperer and the greatest Viking Hero who ever lived. But it wasn't always like that. Hiccup's memoirs look back to when Hiccup was just an ordinary boy, and finding it very hard to be a Hero.  Can Hiccup find Grimbeard the Ghastly's treasure before Alvin the Treacherous gets his sneaky hands on it? And if Hiccup opens a box that says DO NOT OPEN, will he live to tell the tale?  

How to Train Your Dragon is now a major DreamWorks franchise starring Gerard Butler, Cate Blanchett and Jonah Hill and the TV series, Riders of Berk, can be seen on CBeebies and Cartoon Network.  

Listen to the rest of Hiccup's exploits in the rest of the series and check out the all-new Hiccup website at www.howtotrainyourdragonbooks.com. It's the place to go for games, downloads, activities and sneak peeks!
