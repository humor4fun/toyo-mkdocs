| Author | Deborah Diesen |

**Description**:

One night in the ocean, the Pout-Pout Fish can't get to sleep! He's all ready for bed, but he just can't catch a snooze. When he asks his friends for advice, they're all sure they know what he should do - count sheep, use a pillow made of rocks, swim in circles - but nothing works. What to do when good advice isn't good for everyone? 

Little guppies will love The Pout-Pout Fish and the Can't-Sleep Blues, a bedtime story about learning from experience and doing what's best for you!
