| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

A seafaring tale of daring do in a long dress and petticoats! At the young age of 15, Ida Lewis helped her father with his lighthouse keeper’s duties on Lime Rock. She grew to become the small island’s sole keeper responsible for protecting and guiding ships to safe harbor. Throughout her life, Ida fearlessly rowed her small skiff out in rough storms and icy waters to rescue people (and a sheep). She became famous after saving two drowning soldiers in a snowstorm and was named, “the bravest woman in America.” But the lighthouse, not the limelight, was where Ida Lewis found her lifelong happiness.
