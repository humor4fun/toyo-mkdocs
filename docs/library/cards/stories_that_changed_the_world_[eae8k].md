**Description**:

We all love stories.  

In this collection, we explore some of the people and stories from history that in some way, changed the world.   

The Titanic:  In 1912, a ship that was the biggest and most impressive ever built set sail from the UK, heading to New York in the US.   
We explore what life was like aboard The Titanic and what we’ve learned from the problems it faced.   

Boston Tea Party:  The Boston Tea Party sounds like it could be a delightful event... with cakes and tea and maybe even some dancing? But this is a tale of how a group of people used ships full of tea to make a very important, and world-changing, protest.   

Great Fire Of London: In 1666, a great fire raged across London, having started in a bakery in Pudding Lane. The lessons learnt from this have changed the cities where we live, forever.
   
Martin Luther King Jr.:  Martin Luther King Jr. had a dream...  to create a world that was equal for everyone.   
Find out about Martin Luther King Jr’s incredible life and achievements and all he did to help change the world for the better.   

Women’s Suffrage Movement:  In the late 19th Century, life for Women was very different and often very unfair.   
Groups of women in both the UK and US formed groups and organisations to help to tackle the problems facing women and to help to work towards a more equal future.
