| Title | Songs from Ukraine |
| Author | Yoto |

**Description**:

Songs from Ukraine is a collection of five traditional Ukrainian children’s songs, recording in Kyiv by vocalist Iryna Kulshenka in collaboration with a host of UK-based musicians and producers.

The songs are a combination of local folks songs, singalong children’s tunes and the Ukrainian version of a universally loved lullaby.

As well as being a means to raise funds we also believe this is a way to share Ukrainian musical culture with children and families around the world, providing a platform for dialogue and discussion around the war.

All proceeds from the sale of this card will go to the Disasters Emergency Committee, which brings together 15 leading charities to raise funds quickly and efficiently at times of crisis overseas.

DEC charities and their local partners are in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries providing food, water, shelter and medical assistance.

Tracklist:
Two Merry Geese (Два веселих гуся) 
Two Roosters (Два півника) 
The Dream Passes The Window (Ой ходить сон, коло вікон) 
Grey Cat  (Котику Cіренький) 
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star (Зірко, зірко мерехти) 

All vocals by Iryna Kulshenka

With thanks for the producers and musicians who donated their time: Sam Gale (1) Ben Cullum (2 & 5), Storytime Soundtracks (3), Tom McCarthy (4)
