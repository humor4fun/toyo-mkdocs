| Author | M. L. Gold, N. V. Fong |

**Description**:

A little girl and her dog Buddy are waiting for their new baby brother or sister. To pass the time, she makes crayon drawings of the baby. It helps her tell Buddy a story about how the whole process works. How sometimes, there are mothers who love their babies but know it’s better for them to live with another family. Those mothers look for a family that’s waiting for a baby. A family like hers and Buddy’s. Buddy isn’t very patient. But the little girl knows the big day is coming soon. When it finally gets here, she’ll draw a big welcome picture. The “maybe baby” will be someone they can love forever—and the baby can love them too!
