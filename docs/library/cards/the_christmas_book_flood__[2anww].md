**Description**:

AN INDIE BESTSELLER!  

This lovely and lyrical picture book, based on a real Icelandic tradition, brings all the sparkle and anticipation of Christmas—and of the joys of reading—to the page.  The northern lights dance, snow blankets the ground, it’s the Christmas season—so the Book Flood begins!  People plan and they dream, and they visit the shops for books to give loved ones, and families, and friends.  And when Christmas Eve comes, they’ll share magical stories, curl up by the fire, and read, read, read, read…  

With gorgeous artwork and a diverse cast of characters, Emily Kilgore and Kitty Moss's The Christmas Book Flood is a surefire holiday classic.
