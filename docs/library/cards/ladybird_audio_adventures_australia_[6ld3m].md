**Description**:

Brought to you by Ladybird.    

Follow our fearless adventurers Cassandra and Otto and Missy, (the smartest bird in the universe) as they set out on their next action-packed Ladybird Audio Adventure!     

On this adventure we're travelling right around the world - to visit Australia! We're going to learn about everything this brilliant vibrant county has to offer. We're going to learn about the amazing Great Barrier Reef, see the magnificent Uluru, encounter some wonderful wildlife and we might even have time to take in a performance at the Opera House!      

These stories help children learn about their environment on a journey of discovery with narrators Ben Bailey Smith (a.k.a. Doc Brown, rapper, comedian and writer) and Sophie Aldred (best known for her role as Ace in Doctor Who).     

Ladybird Audio Adventures is an award-winning original series for three to seven year-olds; an entertaining and engaging way for children to learn about the world around them. These are special stories written exclusively for audio, so little ones can become their own adventurers with fun sound and musical effects that are perfect for listening at home, before bed and on long journeys.
