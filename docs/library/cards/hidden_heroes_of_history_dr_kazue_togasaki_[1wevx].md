| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

A story of duty, dedication, and deliveries! Dr. Kazue Togasaki was one of the first Japanese American women to become a doctor in the US. Inspired by her experience in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, she overcame gender and racial barriers to start her own medical practice. But it was living in a Japanese internment camp during World War II where she showed her moxie - setting up make-shift facilities to provide vital health care to her community and delivering over 10,000 babies during the course of her career.
