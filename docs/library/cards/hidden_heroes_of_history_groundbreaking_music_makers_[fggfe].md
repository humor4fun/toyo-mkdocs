**Description**:

Inspiring stories of chart-topping trailblazers! Ritchie Valens broke cultural barriers with his musical style and sparked the game-changing Chicano rock movement. Carol Kaye was the only woman on the famous ‘Wrecking Crew’. Always in high demand, she laid down iconic bass tracks during 10,000 recording sessions. Sister Rosetta Tharpe crossed boundaries in sound and performance to become the Godmother of Rock and Roll, and creator of one of the very first recorded rock tracks. These three groundbreaking music makers played to the beat of their own drums and changed the tune of music history forever.
