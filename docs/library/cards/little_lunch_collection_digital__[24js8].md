**Description**:

_**Yoto Says: The original eight books from Australian’s favourite and award-winning children’s series all together in one laugh-out-loud collection.**_  

Now also a global hit TV series on Netflix and ABC Me  

Meet Manny, Max and Elsa, Melanie Applebum, Rory, Atticus Busby, Battie, Amba, Debra Jo-Woo, Tamara Noodle and Mrs Gonsha as they get up to all sorts of shenanigans during Little Lunch.  

Follow the crew as they invent a new ball game, eat BAD birthday Pavlova, have a Disgusting Joke Competition, play Chinese Whispers, fight over what kind of sandwich Manny was eating, squeeze through the portable classroom and the fence, bring in exactly 100 things from home, find something GROSS in the sandpit, and more…  

What else can happen in fifteen minutes?

3.  The Bubblers 
4.  The School Gate 
5.  Old Climbing Tree
