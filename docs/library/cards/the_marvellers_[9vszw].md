**Description**:

_**Yoto says: The first magical installment in The New York Times bestselling fantasy adventure series for children.**_

The NEW YORK TIMES bestselling Middle Grade debut from Dhonielle Clayton. 'The Marvellers deserves the highest compliment I can give a book: I want to live in this world' - Rick Riordan, author of the Percy Jackson series Eleven-year-old Ella Durand is the first Conjuror to attend the Arcanum Training Institute, a magic school in the clouds for Marvellers from around the world. Ella discovers that being the first isn't easy but she finds friendship in fellow misfits Brigit, a girl who hates magic, and Jason, a boy with a fondness for magical creatures and support from her Elixirs teacher, Masterji Thakur. Then the notorious Ace of Anarchy escapes prison, supposedly with a Conjuror's aid, and Ella finds herself as the prime suspect. Worse, Masterji Thakur mysteriously disappears while away on a research trip. With the help of her friends and her own growing powers, Ella must find a way to clear her family's name and track down her mentor before it's too late.
