| Title | Fry Bread: A Native American Family Story |
| Author | Kevin Noble Maillard |

**Description**:

**Yoto says:** This award-winning, evocative depiction of a modern Native American family tells a tale of a family coming together to create a meaningful meal and new memories.

Fry bread is food. It is warm and delicious, piled high on a plate. Fry bread is time. It brings families together for meals and new memories. Fry bread is nation. It is shared by many, from coast to coast and beyond. Fry bread is us. It is a celebration of old and new, traditional and modern, similarity and difference.

Told in lively and powerful verse by debut author Kevin Noble Maillard, Fry Bread is an evocative depiction of a modern Native American family.
