| Title | Claude in the Country |
| Author | Alex T. Smith |

**Description**:

_**Yoto Says**: Life in the country is every dog’s dream, isn’t it? As Claude escapes to the farm, he realises that it’s a lot more work than it looks. Watch out for the cow pat Claude!_

Claude is no ordinary dog - he leads an extraordinary life!  
  
A quiet walk in the country turns into a busy day on the farm when Claude ends up mucking out the pigs, feeding the chickens and lassoing a fearsome bull!
