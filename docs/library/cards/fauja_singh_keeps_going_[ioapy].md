**Description**:

**Yoto says:** This true story of the first 100-year-old marathon runner reminds us that it's both where we start and how we finish that makes our journey unforgettable!

Fauja Singh was born determined. He was also born with legs that wouldn't allow him to play cricket with his friends or carry him to school miles from his village in Punjab. But that didn't stop him. Working on his family's farm, Fauja grew stronger to meet his own full potential. He never stopped striving.  
  
At the age of 81, after a lifetime of making his body, mind, and heart stronger, Fauja decided to run his first marathon. He went on to break records all around the world and became the first person over 100 to complete the grueling long-distance race.  
  
This exuberant true story of Fauja Singh reminds us that it's both where we start and how we finish that makes our journey unforgettable.
