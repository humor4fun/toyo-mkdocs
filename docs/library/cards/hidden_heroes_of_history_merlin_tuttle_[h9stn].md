| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

A story of bat caves, field notes and righting a wrong reputation! Merlin Tuttle has spent his career studying bats and proving why they are an incredibly vital part of the ecosystem. His research, books, lectures and National Geographic style photography have led to the knowledge that bats are not spooky but spectacular! Meet the hero who showed the world that the some of the smallest creatures are making the biggest contributions—the real “batman” and champion protector of nature’s delightful, dark-winged, do-gooders.
