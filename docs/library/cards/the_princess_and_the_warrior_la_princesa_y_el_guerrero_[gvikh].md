**Description**:

_**Yoto Says: A charming iteration of a Mexican folktale about love and commitment.**_  

_**Yoto Dice: Una magnífica versión de la popular leyenda mexicana sobre el amor y el compromiso.**_

A re-imagining of one of Mexico's cherished legends.  

Una magnífica versión de una de las más preciadas leyendas de México.

Izta was the most beautiful princess in the land, and suitors traveled from far and wide to woo her. She fell in love with Popoca, a brave warrior who fought in her father’s army—and a man who did not offer her riches but a promise to stay by her side forever. The emperor did not want his daughter to marry a mere warrior, but he offered Popoca a deal: If the warrior could defeat their enemy, Jaguar Claw, then the emperor would permit Popoca and Izta to wed. But Jaguar Claw had a plan to thwart the warrior. Would all be lost?
