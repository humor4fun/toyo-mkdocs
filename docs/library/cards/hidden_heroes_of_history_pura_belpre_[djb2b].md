**Description**:

A tale of storytelling magic and handmade puppets from the Bronx to the Lower East Side! Pura Belpré was the very first Puerto Rican librarian hired by the New York Public Library. She was an advocate for Spanish-speaking communities and was responsible for introducing bilingual story hours, authoring children’s stories in Spanish, and releasing the first book of translated Puerto Rican folktales in the U.S. Ms. Belpré was a visionary whose literary programs kept new generations connected to their Hispanic culture and showed all children that their stories matter.
