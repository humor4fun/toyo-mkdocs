| Title | Mindfulness Moments for Kids: Three Calming Activities |
| Author | Kira Willey |

**Description**:

Written and read by Kira Willey, winner of three Parents' Choice Gold Awards, kids can use these three mindfulness activities to manage their bodies, breath, and emotions.With Breathe Like a Bear, kids will learn to breathe deeply and soothe themselves slowly to sleep, just like a bear in hibernation.With Bunny Breaths, kids learn how to replenish their energy with quick, focused breaths - no matter how blah they feel. With Listen Like an Elephant, kids learn to slow down, listen to the world around them, and focus their minds - no matter how messy life becomes.These exercises for calm and focus can be done anywhere: in the backseat of a car, at home, or at a child's desk at school.
