Humza Khan is the greatest eleven-year-old rapper Eggington has ever known: he is Little Badman and he is destined to be rich and famous. But when Humza's music teacher is taken ill his dreams are put on hold. His Auntie has stepped in as substitute, and nobody seems to care about the unorthodox teaching because of the endless sweet treats.

As other teachers start to disappear, with more Aunties appearing in their place, Humza knows something isn't right. With the help of his elderly Uncle and friends Umer and Wendy, Humza discovers that the suspicious Aunties might not be as friendly as they seem. Now he must find a way to destroy them before they take over the world...
