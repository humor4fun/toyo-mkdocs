| Title | We the Children Podcast |
| Author | We The Children - Kids Talk Climate Solutions |

**Description**:

We The Children is a podcast designed for young minds eager to explore the discussion around climate change.  Zach Fox-Devol, our curious, 12-year-old host engages with experts, educators, and activists to discuss topics about the current state and future of our planet. Zach brings attention to critical topics of climate change and global warming solutions. With a lighthearted approach and insights from a kid’s perspective, he includes segments on climate trivia and invites Waldo The Wacky Weatherman to share humor and expertise on the intersection of weather and climate change.  We The Children embraces the idea that young individuals, like Zach and his listeners, can contribute significantly to the global conversation about the environment. Instead of providing all the answers, Zach encourages the asking of essential questions to those dedicating their careers to climate action and sustainability. From understanding the impact of recycling efforts to exploring a "green economy," each episode transforms big concepts into comprehensive realities. Aimed at both students and teachers, "We the Children" is not just an educational tool but an invitation for young minds to join a green movement, become Earth's guardians, and collectively work towards a more sustainable world.
