| Title | Max Magic |
| Author | Stephen Mulhern; Tom Easton |

**Description**:

**Yoto says:** Anything is possible in this magical debut from Stephen Mulhern!

ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE! Max Mullers loves doing magic tricks - his gran has taught him everything he knows! But his tricks aren't enough to keep Bottley the Bully off his back. Then a run-in with Bottley at his parents' market stall gets Max into even bigger trouble - now the notorious East End gangsters the Crayfish Twins are after him!

If Max is going to get out of this one, he'll need A MIRACLE. Fortunately for Max, with magic . . . anything is possible!
