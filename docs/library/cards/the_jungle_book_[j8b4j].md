| Author | Rudyard Kipling |

**Description**:

A Yoto Original adaptation of the classic stories by Rudyard Kipling. The perfect introduction to this adventurous tale for young listeners. Narrated by Adjoa Andoh, and brought to life with music, sound effects, and a full cast. 

Set in the Seoni Hills in the Jungles of India, this adventure follows the story of Mowgli, an orphaned boy adopted and raised by a pack of wolves. 

With help from his wolf family, wise panther Bagheera and lovable sloth bear, Baloo, Mowgli learns all about the law of the jungle as he grows up among the trees, rivers and wildlife. 

But not every animal in the jungle is as welcoming to young Mowgli. He is a human cub after all, and many in the jungle fear humans. 

Follow along as Mowgli struggles to discover where he fits in in the world, meeting a few mischievous monkeys, slithering snakes, and a ferocious tiger, Shere Khan, along the way. Can he live in harmony with the other animals, or is he destined to live back among the humans?
