| Title | Laurie Berkner's Food Songs |
| Author | The Laurie Berkner Band |

**Description**:

Rock along with award-winning children’s music artist Laurie Berkner and her band. In this album, you’ll do the fruit salad salsa, travel through the valley of vegetables, swim in soup and have a Thanksgiving Day feast!

Laurie says: “Food is one of my favorite things to write songs about. In fact, it’s one of my favorite things, period! Whatever foods you like to eat, I hope you’ll find a song in this collection that makes you happy. You may even discover a food you have never tried before!” Laurie Berkner has sold over 1.1 million albums since her start in 1992. With 10 award-winning albums, critics widely acknowledge Laurie’s major contribution to launching what is now dubbed the progressive “kindie rock” movement.
