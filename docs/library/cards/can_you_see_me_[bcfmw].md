| Title | Can You See Me |
| Author | Libby Scott; Rebecca Westcott |

**Description**:

_**Yoto says:** A touching and insightful story of autism, empathy and kindness, inspired by the diary of a young girl._

With diary entries written by 11-year-old Libby Scott, based on her own experiences of autism, this pioneering book, written in collaboration with esteemed author Rebecca Westcott, has been widely praised for its realistic portrayal of autism.

Tally is 11 years old, and she's just like her friends. Well, sometimes she is. If she tries really hard to be. Because there's something that makes Tally not the same as her friends. Something she can't cover up, no matter how hard she tries: Tally is autistic.

Tally's autism means there are things that bother her even though she wishes they didn't. It means that some people misunderstand her and feel frustrated by her.

People think that because Tally's autistic, she doesn't realise what they're thinking, but Tally sees and hears - and notices - all of it. And, honestly? That's not the easiest thing to live with. Endearing, insightful and warmly uplifting, Can You See Me? is a story of autism, empathy and kindness that will touch listeners of all ages.
