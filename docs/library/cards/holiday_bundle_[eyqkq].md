**Description**:

_**Yoto Says: Celebrate the spirit of the winter holidays with these three magical stories about traditions, history and family!**_

**Stories for Hanukkah:** These uplifting stories are perfect for young children celebrating The Festival of Lights with their friends and family, or wanting to learn about different Jewish traditions. These stories are aimed at children aged three to six for family listening, learning and the development of young minds.

**The People Remember**: The People Remember tells the journey of African descendants in America by connecting their history to the seven principles of Kwanzaa.

It begins in Africa, where people were taken from their homes and families. They spoke different languages and had different customs. Yet they were bound and chained together and forced onto ships sailing into an unknown future. Ultimately, all these people had to learn one common language and create a culture that combined their memories of home with new traditions that enabled them to thrive in this new land.

Sumptuously illustrated, this is an important book to read as a family—a story young readers can visit over and over again to deepen their understanding of African American history in relation to their own lives and current social justice movements. By turns powerful and revealing, this is a lyrical narrative that tells the story of survival, as well as the many moments of joy, celebration, and innovation of Black people in America.
