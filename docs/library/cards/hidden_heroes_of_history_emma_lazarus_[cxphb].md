| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

A story of empathy in action and the power of words! Emma Lazarus' life is a testament to courage and compassion—from her literary work to her tireless advocacy for Jewish immigrants coming to America for the chance of better lives. Her most iconic poem, The New Colossus, helped raise the funds to build the Statue of Liberty. The poem’s timeless message of welcoming ‘the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free,’ has remained as a symbol of hope and inclusion for generations.
