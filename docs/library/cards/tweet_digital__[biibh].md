**Description**:

_**Yoto Says: Join Jay on his journey to Africa to find his mum and dad, the famous bird scientists!**_ 

Birds.    

Lots of birds.    

The people of the world are puzzled. Their feathered friends are trying to tell them something, and they’re not sure what it is.    

Then a boy and his pet budgie discover the secret.    

Join Jay and Clyde, and their friends Maxine and Dora, on an exciting, funny, risky journey to save their families.    

And every other family too.

**The 'Tweet' physical card will arrive to Yoto in January 2025.
