| Title | Flamingo Flamenco |
| Author | Brooke Jorden |

**Description**:

Every creature on Earth has a dance all its own. The hippos are down with hip-hop. The wallabies perform a waltz. The camels are known to cancan in a chorus line, and the sloths slow dance one toe at a time. But when all the tapping tigers have pranced, and the ballerina bears have finished their final spin, is any dance quite as remarkable as the flamingo’s flamenco? Clap your hands, wings, and claws. Tap your shoes, hooves, and talons. The flamingo is about to show the animal kingdom how it’s done.
