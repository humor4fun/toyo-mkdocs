Dragons vs Humans: can Hiccup save the dragons? Find out in the EPIC finale to the How to Train Your Dragon series, read by David Tennant. It is the Doomsday of Yule. At the end of this day, either the humans or the dragons will face extinction. Alvin the Treacherous is about to be crowned the King of the Wilderwest on the island of Tomorrow. His reign of terror will begin with the destruction of dragons everywhere.

The fate of the dragon world lies in the hands of one young boy as he stands on the nearby isle of Hero's End with nothing to show, but everything to fight for. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock the Third's Quest is clear. First he must defeat the Dragon Guardians of Tomorrow and prove that he is in fact the rightful king, even though Hiccup has none of the King's Things and Alvin the Treacherous has all ten of them. And then he faces his final battle: Hiccup must fight the Dragon Furious and end the Rebellion ... ALONE. As Doomsday draws to an end can Hiccup be the Hero of the hour? Will the dragons survive?

How to Train Your Dragon is now a major DreamWorks franchise. How to Train Your Dragon 3 is scheduled for 2017 starring Cate Blanchett and Jonah Hill and the TV series, Defenders of Berk, can be seen on CBBC and Netflix. Hear all of Hiccup's exploits in the series:
