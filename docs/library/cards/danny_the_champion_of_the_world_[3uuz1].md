| Author | Roald Dahl |

**Description**:

_**Yoto Says: Join Danny and his ingenious father as they plan to trick Mr Hazel!**_

Danny and his dad hatch a mischief-making plot against Mr Hazell, but can they pull it off without getting caught?

Brought to you by Penguin.    

Danny the Champion of the World is narrated by actor Alfred Enoch (Harry Potter, How To Get Away With Murder), and is bursting with fantabulous sound effects.    

"A stodgy parent is no fun at all. What a child wants and deserves is a parent who is sparky"    

Danny has the most marvellous and exciting father anyone ever had. He can repair any car or machine that people bring to him, loves going on adventures with Danny and tells him incredible stories around the stove in the cozy caravan they call home. The land around them belongs to Mr Hazell, a rich bully who NOBODY likes, not one-little bit. So, Danny and his father concoct a daring plot that will give Mr Hazell the greatest shock of his life. But can they pull off this level of mischief-making without getting caught...?   

The text in this edition of Danny the Champion of the World was updated in 2022 for young independent readers.
