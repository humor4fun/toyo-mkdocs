| Author | Craig Robinson, Leslie Harter |

**Description**:

Every kid in Little Craig's town wants the exact same thing: a shiny, yellow 10-speed bike! After lots of chores and lots of homework, Craig's dreams come true, and his mom buys him the prized bicycle. He's off to the races, wheeling around town as happy as can be. Until a fateful encounter finds a police officer questioning Craig about where he got his new bike. Things suddenly take a turn for the worse, and he is accused of something he didn't do.
