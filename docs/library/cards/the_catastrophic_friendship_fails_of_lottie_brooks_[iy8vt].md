**Description**:

**_Yoto says: Lottie is back at school for spring term but, despite her best efforts, things appear to be going off the rails!_**

Brought to you by Puffin. The hilarious sequel to The Extremely Embarrassing Life of Lottie Brooks by the bestselling author, Katie Kirby. Lottie Brooks is back for spring term at secondary school and ready to face anything. No more trying to impress mean girl Amber. And absolutely no more being nicknamed Cucumber Girl. A lead role in the spring musical gives Lottie a chance to dazzle her mega-crush Daniel with her talent as a singing crab but it's not all singing and dancing at Kingswood High. Lottie's friendship with Molly and Jess seems to be falling apart no matter how hard she tries to keep her BFFs together. Is Lottie on track for another epic friendship fail?
