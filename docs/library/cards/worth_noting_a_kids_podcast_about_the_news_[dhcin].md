| Title | Worth Noting: A Kids Podcast About the News |
| Author | A Kids Co. |

**Description**:

A Kids Podcast About Current Events. We know the news can be heavy. World events can be confusing. But no one should miss out on history as it’s being made. It’s not always easy to know how to talk about what’s going on in the world or even to know where to start. Join us each week for a look at what’s going on in the world and how it impacts you and others. From scientific breakthroughs to historic achievements. From political upheaval to social justice. It’s all worth noting.
