**Description**:

Brought to you by Penguin.    

The Enormous Crocodile is narrated by award-winning comedian Tom Allen, and is bursting with fantabulous sound effects.    

"For my lunch today", he said, I would like a nice JUICY little child."    

The Enormous Crocodile is planning what to have for his lunch. He's the greediest croc in the whole river, and he wants to eat something juicy and delicious. But what can the greedy grumptious brute guzzle up? Beware! He's looking for someone to feast upon... someone who looks a lot like YOU!    

The text in this edition of The Enormous Crocodile was updated in 2022 for young independent readers.
