**Description**:

Yoto Says: Learn how eleven courageous First Ladies, from Washington to Obama, overcame challenges to make the world better—see how their stories inspire us today.

Martha Washington grew up on a farm. Dolley Madison helped her mom run a boarding house. Eleanor Roosevelt became an orphan when she was nine years old. But like so many women before them, they didn’t let their circumstances determine who they’d be. They read, and they wrote. They taught, and they listened. And they left a mark on the world that we still see today in our parks, schools, and workplaces. From Washington to Obama, come learn from eleven courageous women who did their best to make change for the better. Will you change the world in your own way? And when you do, will your name be listed next to theirs? The whole world is waiting to find out.
