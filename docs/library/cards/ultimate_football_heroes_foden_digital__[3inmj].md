Foden is one of the hottest talents in the world and his rise through the Manchester City first team has been remarkable. He has matured from Man City youth prospect, to the first footballer ever to be named Premier League Young Player of the Season in consecutive years, despite competing for a position in a team of world class players. And this is testament to his silky style of play and natural flair for football. Discover how Foden grew as a product of Manchester City's dynamic youth system, nurtured under the guidance of Guardiola and finally evolved into an English generational talent!  

Ultimate Football Heroes  is a series of biographies telling the life stories of the biggest and best footballers in the world and their incredible journeys from childhood fan to superstar professional player. Written in fast-paced,  action-packed style these audiobooks are perfect for all the family to collect and share.
