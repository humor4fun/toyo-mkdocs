| Title | The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me NEW |
| Author | Roald Dahl |

**Description**:

_**Yoto Says: What if Billy's dreams came true? Join Billy, Pelly and Monkey as they embark on an adventure like no other!**_

Meet Billy and his flock of friends: a monkey, a giraffe and a pelican who might just be able to make his dreams come true!

Brought to you by Penguin.    

The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me is narrated by comedian and presenter Noel Fielding (The Mighty Boosh), and is bursting with fantabulous sound effects.    

"The Pelican spread his huge white wings and flew down on to the road beside me. 'Hop in,' he said, opening his enormous beak . . ."    

MEET BILLY. A kid with a dream. He wants to turn an old wooden house into an incredible sweetshop full of treats! AND MEET THE LADDERLESS WINDOW-CLEANING COMPANY: Monkey, Pelican (Pelly) and Giraffe (who needs ladders when you've got a giraffe?!). They have just landed a big break cleaning all six hundred and seventy-seven windows of the mansion owned by the richest man in all of England! All they need now is a little help from Billy.    

Can these unlikely new friends make Billy's wildest dreams come true and take him on an adventure he'll never forget . . .?    

The text in this edition of The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me was updated in 2022 for young independent readers.
