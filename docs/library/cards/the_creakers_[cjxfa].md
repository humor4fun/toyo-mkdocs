**Description**:

_**Yoto says:** One morning, Lucy wakes up to find all the grown-ups have disappeared! Can she find her mum and avoid the Creakers?_

_Penguin presents The Creakers by Tom Fletcher, read by Samantha Bond with an introduction by the author.  
  
What silently waits in the shadows at night? What's under your bed, keeping just out of sight?  
  
Do you ever hear strange, creaking noises at night? Ever wonder what makes those noises?  
Lucy Dungston always did.  
Until one morning, Lucy discovers that all the grown-ups have disappeared - as if into thin air. Chaos descends as the children in Lucy's town run riot. It's mayhem. It's madness. To most kids, it's amazing!  
But Lucy wants to find out the truth. Lucy lost her dad not long ago, and she's determined not to lose her mum too. She's going to get her back - and nothing is going to stop her . . .  
. . . except maybe the Creakers._
