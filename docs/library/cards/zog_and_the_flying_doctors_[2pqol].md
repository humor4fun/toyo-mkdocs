| Title | Zog and the Flying Doctors |
| Author | Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler |

**Description**:

Meet the Flying Doctors: Princess Pearl, Sir Gadabout and, of course, their trusty ‘air ambulance’, Zog the dragon, in this fabulously original sequel to the bestselling ZOG . There’s much to do, as they fly around tending a sunburnt mermaid, a distressed unicorn and a sneezy lion. But should princesses really be doctors? Pearl’s uncle, the King, doesn’t think so – until he himself falls ill, and only Pearl knows how to cure him.

Brilliantly performed by award-winning actress Imelda Staunton, this card includes the complete, best-selling story with music, The Can Princesses Be Doctors?  song, a listening game, and a readalong version of the story with musical page turns to use with a copy of the book.
