| Title | A Christmas Carol  |
| Author | Charles Dickens |

**Description**:

Gather round the fire with the whole family to indulge in this Yoto Original adaptation of the classic novel by Charles Dickens. The perfect introduction to this Christmas story for young listeners. Narrated by Guy Garvey and brought to life with music, sound effects, and a full cast including Timothy West and Adjoa Andoh. 

Ebenezer Scrooge is a cold-hearted old man, who dislikes most everything, especially Christmas. But everything changes one Christmas eve when he is visited by the ghost of his old business partner Jacob Marley, who warns him of his likely fate and the visit of three more ghosts. 

That night, the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Future take Scrooge on a journey through his own life to show him how his miserly ways have affected those around him. 

Through a series of heart-warming and sometimes a little frightening encounters, Scrooge learns the importance of giving, compassion and community. Can he change his fate and awake on Christmas morning a kinder man? 

This classic tale is a reminder of the true spirit of Christmas.
