| Title | Hidden Heroes of History: Eugenie Clark |
| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

A story of diving, discovery, and the Shark Lady! Fascinated by marine life as a child, Eugenie Clark grew to become a leading ichthyologist and changed the way scientists study ocean life. Throughout her career, she conducted 72 submersible dives, led more than 200 field expeditions, and pioneered the practice of underwater research through scuba diving. She cared deeply for sharks, swimming among them (and riding on the back of a 50-foot whale shark) in order to understand their behaviors. She inspired the public's curiosity, awe, and wonder, turning the tides on what we thought we knew about these misunderstood ocean creatures.
