| Author | Roald Dahl |

**Description**:

_**Yoto Says: When a little girl puts the magic finger upon the cruel Gregg family, very strange things start to happen!**_

Brought to you by Puffin.    

This audio edition of The Magic Finger is narrated by actor and playwright Zawe Ashton (Fresh Meat, The Marvels), and is bursting with fantabulous sound effects.    Out the window they flew, far up into the sky, and soon the whole family was flying around and around together.      

Every Saturday morning the Gregg family goes off to shoot animals and birds. But the girl who lives next door hates hunting.      

Now it's made her so angry that she's PUT THE MAGIC FINGER ON THEM ALL.  And very strange things have begun to happen . . .    

The text in this edition of The Magic Finger was updated in 2022 for young independent readers.
