| Title | The Railway Children (BBC Children’s Classics) |
| Author | E. Nesbit |

**Description**:

**_Yoto Says_**_:_ _Three siblings transported from the city to the country in cryptic circumstances discover new beginnings at the local railway in the much-loved classic._

Paul Copley and Timothy Bateson star in a BBC Radio full-cast dramatisation of E. Nesbit's enchanting and unforgettable classic. Roberta, Peter and Phyllis lead an ordinary suburban life with Mother and Father, enjoying trips to the zoo and the pantomime. But when Father is mysteriously taken away one night, everything changes. The children must move to the country, to a little white cottage near the railway line, where eventually they find that there are plenty of adventures to be had and friends to be made – including Perks the Porter and the Station Master himself. But the mystery remains – what has happened to Father, and will he come back? The story of Roberta, Peter and Phyllis and their life in the country has never been out of print since it was first published in 1906. Charming, sentimental and unforgettable, the novel retains all its enchantment and enduring appeal in this BBC Radio full-cast dramatisation.
