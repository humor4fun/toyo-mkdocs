| Title | Django: World's Greatest Jazz Guitarist |
| Author | Bonnie Christensen |

**Description**:

**Yoto says:** George Guidall brilliantly narrates the story of jazz musician Django Reinhardt against a backdrop of original music.

From extreme poverty in a gypsy camp, through a debilitating injury, Django Reinhardt overcame tremendous obstacles to become a world-renowned, much beloved and highly acclaimed jazz guitarist. This production captures the spirit of the man, his music and his inspiring life story.
