| Author | Lenore Look |

**Description**:

_**Yoto says:** Just when Alvin thought he had faced some of his greatest fears, his biggest nightmare awaits: he has to go camping._

Alvin takes on camping in the second book in the hilarious chapter book series that tackles anxiety in a fun, kid-friendly way. Alvin, an Asian American second grader who's afraid of everything, is back, and his worst fear has come true: he has to go camping.

What will he do exposed in the wilderness with bears and darkness and . . . pit toilets? Luckily, he’s got his night-vision goggles and water purifying tablets and super-duper heavy-duty flashlight to keep him safe. And he’s got his dad, too.

This is a humorous and touching series about facing your fears and embracing new experiences — with a truly unforgettable character.
