| Title | Hidden Heroes of History: Duke Kahanamoku |
| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

A story of sportsmanship, record breaking feats and the Spirit of Aloha! Hawaii’s Duke Kahanamoku is the father of modern surfing, known for catching big waves and globally popularizing the sport. But the Big Kahuna's legendary status went beyond his surfing talents -- he won six Olympic medals for swimming, acted in 30 films, served 13 terms as Honolulu's Sheriff and orchestrated a heroic ocean rescue that forever changed the lifeguard profession. Most importantly, “The Duke” taught us how to live with integrity, show respect for others and approach the world with open arms.
