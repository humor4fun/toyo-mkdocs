| Title | In My Neighborhood |
| Author | Oscar Loubriel |

**Description**:

_**Yoto says: A harmonic story about finding your place in the world.**_

The narrator, a drum, feels like an outcast because he alone―unlike his family and friends―cannot play a melody. Like all kids growing up, he must find out where he fits.
