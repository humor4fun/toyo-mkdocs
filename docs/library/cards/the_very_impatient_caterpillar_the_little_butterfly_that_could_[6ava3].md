| Title | The Very Impatient Caterpillar & The Little Butterfly That Could |
| Author | Ross Burach |

**Description**:

This clever send-up of every child's biggest challenge --being patient!--is a STEM-friendly, laugh-out-loud comedy about metamorphosis.  

HEY! What are you guys doing?  
We're going to metamorphosize.  
Meta-WHAT-now?  
Transform into butterflies.  
Right. Right. I knew that...  
WAIT?! You're telling me I can become a BUTTERFLY?  
Yes.  
With wings?  
Yes.  
Wait for ME!!  

Ross Burach's hilarious, tongue-in-cheek exploration of metamorphosis will make you flutter with glee, while also providing real facts about how caterpillars transform into butterflies. This comical companion to Ross Burach's The Very Impatient Caterpillar pays loving homage to every child's struggle to persist through challenges while also delivering a lighthearted lesson on butterfly migration. Remember, if at first you don't succeed, fly, fly again!

This card includes a read-along and an unabridged version of the story.
