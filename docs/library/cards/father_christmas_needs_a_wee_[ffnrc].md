| Title | Father Christmas Needs a Wee |
| Author | Nicholas Allan |

**Description**:

Bernard Cribbins brings to life the excruciating dilemma that Santa faces every Christmas Eve.
 
On Christmas Eve, every child leaves out a drink and a snack for Father Christmas. Before long he really, really needs a wee but what can he do about it? 
 
There's a long time to wait before he can get home and when he finally does, he's lost his house key! A hilarious take on a dilemma that every toddler will identify with.
