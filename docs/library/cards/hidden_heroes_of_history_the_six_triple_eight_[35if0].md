**Description**:

A story of an extraordinary mission of mail and morale! Overcoming the prejudice of her time, Lieutenant Colonel Charity Adams became the first Black woman to command her own battalion in World War II. Known as the “Six Triple Eight,” she and 855 Black female soldiers were assigned to take up a lost cause - sending 17 million warehoused letters and packages to the soldiers who were longing to hear from their loved ones. Though challenged with troops constantly on the move, thousands of common names, and missing addresses, the dedicated Six Triple Eight delivered the impossible in record time.
