**Description**:

_**Yoto says: A musical-comedy welcoming audiences to the magical kingdom of Rosas, where Asha, a sharp-witted idealist, makes a wish so powerful that it is answered by a cosmic force—a little ball of boundless energy called Star.**_

Together, Asha and Star confront the formidable King Magnifico to save their community, proving that when the will of one courageous human connects with the magic of the stars, wondrous things can happen. Experience this enchanting journey through the magical melodies of Disney's "Wish: The Songs."

Perfect for sparking imagination and creating special moments, each song captures the magic of dreams, hope, and the power of wishes.
