| Author | Molly Murphy |

**Description**:

A story of artistic triumph and long-lasting legacies! Ruth Asawa is one of California's most beloved sculptors and was an influential advocate for arts education. She persisted through extreme prejudice and the injustice of Japanese internment camps to become a master at her craft. Today, her remarkable work lives on—from installations in famous museums, to monuments in city parks, to The Ruth Asawa San Francisco School of the Arts.
