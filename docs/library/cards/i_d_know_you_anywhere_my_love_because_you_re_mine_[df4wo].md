| Title | I'd Know You Anywhere, My Love﻿ & ﻿Because You're Mine |
| Author | Nancy Tillman |

**Description**:

Because You're Mine:  Bestselling author/artist Nancy Tillman celebrates the lifelong bond between parent and child. Not just about newborns, Because You're Mine stands as a testament to a parent's protection and support of their child through all ages and stages.  The clouds can blow, the wind can call, the snow can come, the rain can fall- but they’ll just have to wait in line . . .  Because you’re mine. Because you’re mine.  Like Love You Forever, this is sure to be an evergreen gift and a new classic. 
I'd Know You Anywhere, My Love:  There are things about you quite unlike any other. Things always known by your father or mother. So if you decide to be different one day, no worries… I'd know you anyway.  Every child is special and unique, but every child also loves to dream of being something different. In I'd Know You Anywhere, My Love, bestselling author and artist Nancy Tillman has created another heartfelt masterpiece celebrating the joys of imagination, and the comfort of always knowing that ""you are loved."".
