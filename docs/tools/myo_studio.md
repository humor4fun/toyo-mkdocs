## üí°Tips & Tricksüí°

-   When selecting files to upload onto the Yoto website, sort the files by name so they will import in correct track order.
-   Reverse sorting the icons (so largest number first) when uploading will place them in such a way that the icon for track 01 is the first one (when reading from left to right) in your icon tray, so it is easier to just click each one when adding in succession. Be aware that if an icon had previously been uploaded (even with a different file name), it will not be uploaded a second time.
-   It may be convenient to remove previously uploaded Icons prior to uploading a new batch.
