# Applying To The Archive

## Why is the Archive for verified users only?

We want to make sure that users of the Archive are active contributors to the project, while also growing the library of backed up content for members to access should they lose a card before they can back it up themselves. Requiring that users upload content also provides some assurance that the technical ability to access the Archive.

For this reason, users are also required to have a Gmail account associated with their uploads and which will be granted access to the Archive upon acceptance of the application.

## What are the Submission Requirements to be allowed access to the Archive?

All Users must have a gmail account. The account profile name MUST NOT use the word “yoto” anywhere in it.

Users must upload content to the Archive that is new and not previously uploaded. Before uploading, you can check the [“Wanted!”](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vT34jkCwXpYbBh40GOXAbP6C0RAGt7sI5GxPzOGHG4h7EN3V_fBLWixIpuM4yRq1_Pi6CYXjmXi2NDN/pubhtml) list for highly sought after cards. TOYO is currently only accepting content from Official Yoto cards. Content held in MYO is not currently being accepted.

Requirements to join will evolve with time, and is currently set at **ten (10)** unique official cards (not MYO) that are not already in the Library.

These requirements are subject to change as the Archive grows and new content becomes available.
