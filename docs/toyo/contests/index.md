# Contests

The TOYO community has begun hosting a variety of contests designed to create card artwork, icons, original or copyright-free audio, and even complete playlists. Check out the results of past contests and come to the Discord server to get involved in current contests.

## Contest Types (Yoto)
Contests for Yoto content are distinguished by the following categories. *Minimums may vary per contest*
-	`Card`:  cover art only
-	`Icons`: icons only (perhaps a set of 3-5 minimum)
-	`Audio`: original audio content (minimum of 1-3 tracks, 2-5minute/ea)
-	`Playlist`: cover art + icons + audio (minimum 5?)
