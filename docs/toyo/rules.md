# Community Rules

## Allowed Content

TOYO was created as a place where for content that is specifically related to and formatted for the Yoto ecosystem. Generic audiobooks or other content not formatted for Yoto should be discussed in other forums. To ensure we meet this quality standard, at this time, the Archive is only accepting official Yoto Content. Not MYO Playlists or other audio files will be accepted.

## Archive Membership

Access to files backed up within The Archive as well as the related portions of this Discord Server are limited to TOYO Members. Requirements and instructions for applying for TOYO Membership can be found [here](/the_archive/guides/applying_to_the_archive.md). TOYO Moderators retain the right to revoke membership at any time for any reason.

## Audio Content Submissions

All content submitted to the Archive must be owned by the user uploading and is for the purpose of creating a backup copy only. TOYO Membership is not required to make submissions. Submissions may be made [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfN5bodij-TqQ5cK8EtAz-RqI2DTVnjB3OOc8LpcJ27gcvuZw/viewform). Submissions may be made anonymously, however to receive member credits for submission, a valid email address must be used. 

## Accessing the Archive

## No Audio Content in the Server

## NO PIRACY!

This Discord is NOT to be used to distribute any content that is not owned by the individuals or not in the public domain. This includes audio files as well as any other protected IP.

## Act Like Adults

Most of you coming here are going to be parents. Just pretend your kid is watching you and you should be fine. Try to keep things on topic and clean. Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.

## Spam or Self-promotion

Spam and self promotion are not allowed. This includes invites to external communities, advertisements, etc. If you have a good or service that you think would benefit our community, please reach out to a **@Moderator** prior to advertising. This rule extends both to server channels and toDM-ing members without first asking.

## User Behavior

If you see something against the rules or something that makes you feel unsafe, let staff know in [#contact-toyo](https://discordapp.com/channels/1295352148846055444/1297387976266874991) . We want this server to be an inclusive, friendly space!
