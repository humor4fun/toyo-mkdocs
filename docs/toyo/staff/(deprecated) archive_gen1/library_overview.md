# Library Overview

1. [Inbox](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sJ0UojaPeGd3g2dvsch_0TqejBvX6MuS) â€“ Upload your files into this folder
2. [Saved to be organized](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1shIMqPHpD2CPfeI4Iz6w0tsHVFmas9HW) - Stuff that has been pulled out of the **Inbox** folder, but has not yet gone through the cleanup and organization process. Things will be removed from this folder when they are moved into the **Archive**
3. Archive - the folder where you can find organized content
	- Note: If you are looking in here and it seems like a lot of stuff was deleted, its because we found a flaw in the code to package things and it made a bunch of bad packages. We will replace it when the bug is resolved and new packages can be generated.
	- Packages generated by tools will have a date stamp in the filename. Generally speaking a newer date will be a better/more complete package as tools are improved.
4. [Content Index](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT34jkCwXpYbBh40GOXAbP6C0RAGt7sI5GxPzOGHG4h7EN3V_fBLWixIpuM4yRq1_Pi6CYXjmXi2NDN/pubhtml) - A spreadsheet where you can find the archival content.
