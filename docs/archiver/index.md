# Archiver

Multiple tools exist for archiving your content from personal and professional playlists. The primary tool being developed and supported is [Yoto Json Extractor](https://github.com/afsenovilla/YOTO-json-extractor/tree/main). This is a program written in python for Windows, but probably should work for other OSes.
